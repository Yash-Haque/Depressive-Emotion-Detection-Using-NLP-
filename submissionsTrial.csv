If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xgpxny/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/
"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",doqwow,SQLwitch,1572360722.0,2364,1.0,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/
I put the gun down,113ej4j,nourant,1676511160.0,46,0.99,"Held my gun for what felt a long time. Staring at it, crying. I kept thinking, another world is contained in it. Maybe one where I'm not in so much pain and loneliness.

I don't know what to do anymore,113ixrl,diogenesandcoffee,1676525213.0,3,1.0,"I just turned 30 in October. It was a really hard birthday because I was jobless and depressed about it. All my friends my age have careers. I have a string of contract jobs or just failed jobs. Shortly after my birthday, I was hired at a great company and really saw a future there. I was ecstatic. Then came the news...they hired too many people. They were overstaffed. Layoffs happened.   


And now...I just feel lost. Just another failed job in a string of failed or short-lived jobs. I feel so discouraged and worthless. I can't do another 50 years of contract jobs and jobs that don't work out. Everyone keeps saying it won't always be like this, but it's been years, and it's STILL LIKE THIS. My parents always made it known that I was the reason we had no money (I was born disabled), and the other day after winding up in the hospital, my mom made a joke about how I was now a financial burden to my husband instead of my them (my parents). And that just BROKE me. Now, I have no job so it has become even more true.  


I feel like a worthless leech that just adds nothing to the world, and though I would never off myself, I often find myself wishing that my birth defect had just outright killed me instead of leaving me with lasting brain damage that just ruined any life I could have hoped to have. I wrecked my family, and now I feel like I am wrecking my husband's life.

I’m not sure how to proceed,113j8ip,mjones654321,1676526282.0,2,1.0,"I’m at a crossroads in my life and I’m not sure how to proceed. I turn 30 later this year and I’ve gotten into this rhythm of really bad compulsive behavior. Ever since covid started I’ve been working from home which has made matters worse.

First off, I have a huge drinking problem. Since I’m now working from home I have been drinking at least once a week in a binge fashion and I’ve been hiding it from my wife. I mask my breathe and I’ve found myself to be more productive when I’m a little buzzed. That’s making matters worse because I feel like I need it now to get through the day. Again I’m only doing it once a week but it’s been getting worse lately. 

Secondly, I’m a compulsive gambler. I’ve been going to the casino during work hours and playing and sometimes winning money but sometimes losing money. Regardless of what I win it never seems to be enough. It’s not for entertainment anymore it’s for a dopamine rush. I’ve also lost thousands of dollars doing risky options trading on the stock market. 

Thirdly, I’m not sure how to describe this but I’m addicted to pornography and it has lead to me having homosexual fantasies. I’m not sure if I’m gay/bi or whatnot but I feel as though the porn has pushed me towards more taboo things to help me get off. Now I’m addicted. It causes me to struggle intimately with my wife. Again I’m not trying say anything is wrong with being gay or whatnot but I truly feel like pornography has caused this dopamine imbalance in my life and more riskier and compulsive things are the only things that can make me feel that rush and “happiness”. 

Yesterday I had to take a drive to make myself calm my nerves and I got into a car accident. I hit a car that swerved over into my lane and it was a pretty bad accident. High speed and all that. I didn’t know how to explain it to my wife so I lied about the car accident and said I randomly saw the damage on the car that evening. Before I get ripped on it I actually wasn’t drunk or anything while driving. Fully sober but now that I’m sitting in bed contemplating what happened I’m upset that I lied to to my wife.

Now I don’t know what to do or how to proceed. If I tell my wife all the above I run the risk of losing her. If I don’t and I tell myself I’ll stop on my own I probably won’t stop. I’m starting to believe I’m some sort of sociopath but I truly feel bad about it. I just don’t want to lose what I have. But I also don’t want to be dependent on these addictions for the rest of my life.

I’ve been in and out and recently I took another break after dropping the one and only class that I was going to fail. This was back in 2021. Since then I’ve been diagnosed with depression and got on antidepressants. They’ve somewhat helped but I still struggle with my motivation and outlook. 

It would be a dream come true to pass my classes this time around. I know it’s up to me and I want to do better. I’m afraid I’ll fail again and even worse never finish college. 

Is anyone else with depression currently in school and how do you do it? How do you actually sit there and do your homework? Or wake up early to go to class?

I need to let go of this happy friend and don't know how,113dmf7,CleanieBeanie,1676508545.0,3,0.81,"I'm actually improving with baby steps right now. A part of self care is to distance yourself from people who don't fit with you very well.

I have this one friend who is chronically happy and content. I've known them for a long time and it's just the way they are. They struggle with simple things from time to time but they always come up with some stupid healthy behaviour. 
It's almost pathological how deeply happy this person is. I'm 100% sure this is not fake.
I'm happy for them that they can feel this way, but I don't. And I hate to be friends with them.

I don't like being that burden friend who puts the mood down. When I do I think they don't really understand even though they try. I don't like sharing some interests and world views but ultimately living a vastly different life. 
I hate being envy. I hate having to bottle up my feelings. 

It makes me feel miserable spending time with them. The worst thing is that they can't be critizised in any way. They're loyal, caring, trustworthy, capable of meaningful interaction and much more but just.. different than me.

I can't just come up to them and say ""Hey I'm depressed and want people around me dealing with similar life situations and the journey of healing"".

I'm not good at honest communication in general so I mostly swallow my feelings and still spend time with them. Not even the old disappearing trick worked because they're too kind and understanding.

Reasons for: I like it, I will get fit, physical activity makes you happy

Reasons against: I have terrible social skills, no experience, no one to go with, no money, can’t afford it when I need to save for the future and pay bills, I can’t allow myself to work more than I’m able to cause I just can’t probably cause of my adhd and depression and social anxiety but I’d rather kill myself than start a 9to5 job only to afford something I at that point won’t have energy to attend to.

Im not completely quiet around people, I mean I crack jokes and have a good time with people but sometimes I really wish it came easier yknow? Is it wrong for wanting that?

How to stop hating yourself,113b3jq,noth1ngnowh3r3,1676501744.0,3,1.0,"Sorry for this being so long winded, I just want to get the right angle.

I was born into a very low-class neighborhood. My parents had been having issues (my dad cheating when he was out of the state for work and my mom being a cocaine addict) so they decided to sell the house and me and my mom would move around state to state with my dad wherever he had to go to work. When I was going to school in El Paso (2nd grade) was the first time I ever remember feeling self conscious about my looks. We returned to my hometown when I was 9. This is about the same time I was put in special ed classes because of my undiagnosed ADHD. I was already the fat kid, so this made the verbal abuse even worse. I finally got diagnosed with ADHD in 6th grade and prescribed Adderall, but I hated how it made me feel and never got a refill. I started playing football baseball and wrestling and got in decent shape and I felt a lot better about myself, until my sophomore year when I broke my ribs in football and stopped doing sports and started skating instead.

I was still pretty overweight at this time which kept wearing on my self image. I started smoking weed which evolved into a reliance on Xanax, habit that lasted about 6 months, but I feel like that was the spark that formed into the wildfire of depression I feel to this day. The whole time I maintained honor roll grades which gave me some sense of invincibility. Covid hit and I started smoking weed basically constantly. Grades dropped slightly but still above average (went from a 3.8 to a 3.4). One night my parents caught me and decided to make me enroll in a christian private school the second half of my junior year.

I didn't want to go but there was no reasoning with them. It wasn't that bad especially considering my lifelong best friend went there (two grades below me). The worst thing about it was the feeling of inferiority because of the wealth of my classmates, even though at this point we were in a much better financial situation. Besides one kid that I'd played football with in middle school and a girl that I'd ""dated"" (for about two weeks in freshman year), I didn't know anybody in my class. Everybody else had grown up together at their expensive private k-12 schools and had parents that graduated college and owned multiple houses, while both my parents dropped out and we live in a small house they saved up for years just to put a down payment on. I was (literally) laughed at for saying I was planning to go to community college.

This is the time where I decided to start going to the gym and dropped from 260 to 190. I'd lost my virginity and had a girlfriend before, but random attention from girls was really new to me. I figured that me not being confident and never having any ability with girls was the reason I was depressed (Forgive me for being a dumbass 16 year old). My last relationship had ended in me being cheated on which really tore me apart, so I had some weird sense of getting back at her by sleeping with a bunch of different girls that summer. Something like 7 different girls. Didn't help at all, I now had the feeling of ""If I'm not hooking up with someone I'm doing something wrong"". And I know a lot of former fat kids who have had the same exact experience.

Fast forward to today. I'm in community college and doing okay, but it's hard. Before I was diagnosed with ADHD, I was called a gifted kid and coasted through all of high school, even with a few AP classes, with ease. Having to really work for academic success is new to me and it feels very overwhelming. I've been trying and failing to quit vaping and still smoke weed and any given opportunity. I've gained a bit of weight back (I'm floating around 200 now at 5'10) but nothing crazy. My hairline started receding after I buzzed my head last summer (thanks Dad) so now I feel like I can't leave my room without a hat on. My teeth are kinda fucked up from skating accident also. It feels like I'm right back where I started. A sad, insecure kid with no confidence. My parents have told me therapy would help but I'm scared. I'm scared because at this point I feel like I don't know who I am if I'm not a depressed stoner. Of course I want to get better, but it feels impossible to regain any of the confidence or discipline that I used to have. In a way I don't even feel real sometimes. Just like an invisible soul being thrown through life with no control or direction. It feels good to just let it out, but any help would be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/113b3jq/how_to_stop_hating_yourself/

Had a good relationship with her for 3 years, fucked her every chance I got, she left her husband for me, I ruined this woman, but I fucked her like I would never get to fuck her again everytime I got my hands on her. I stayed with my wife who let me go fuck her once a week for about 3-4 months til it all got out of hand. I love them both but my twin flame is my twin flame. Now after I tried to break up with her and forget her after a month I can’t take life anymore. I sit and get drunk every night and cry and listen to sad music and look at her pictures and cry more and more. I tried to forget her but the more I drink the more I miss her, and I drink so much I can’t stop at this point. I’m good while I’m busy but any down time in life I get I think about her and I cry. I hate to imagine her being alone, or worse her giving herself away to some asshole that don’t even have the slightest clue how to please her. But I stayed with my family for the kids, for my high school sweetheart, I stayed for them and tried to forget my twin flame, the real love of my life.

My life,113hvyg,Typical_pro0,1676521569.0,0,0.5,"Hello, first off I want to say thank you for taking the time to read this and for any replies on this. 

My name is Gavin, I am a Teenage male suffering from depression, anxiety, and ptsd. 

My story starts two years ago when I met my first real “girlfriend” I was the happiest I’d have ever been and didn’t think anything would go wrong. During our relationship it went fairly good with little to no arguments or fights in the first few months, progressively after our 4 month mark the relationship got worse and worse, becoming more corrupt. I started to get abused mentally and physically by this women but couldn’t bring myself to tell anyone or leave the relationship. There where many days she would tell me to kill my self or days she would threaten to hurt me if I didn’t have sex with her or do something she wanted. This went on for about three months and on my bday she broke up with me. This hurt me in a way I’ve never been hurt, I have never been through break up before this and it was all new to me. I later found out that during our relationship she was cheating on me as well as using me for my money. (Total amount estimate was around 15k during our 8 month relationship). This made me really depressed and I felt like I wasn’t good enough for anyone. About a month later she told people I was close with and people from my campus that I had raped her and sexually assaulted her but the truth is that it was the opposite I had been used and abused sexually under my will. And her telling people that made me loose friends and almost had me kicked off of campus. 

Fast forward to now I’m writing this while crying, wondering what to do next. I am still depressed and have anxiety. I’m here for anyone that needs to talk about themselves or wants to talk about my life.

I have a dad that has said on multiple occasions that mental health can be fixed by magical vitamins and exercise when I have physical health issues that make me so unbelievably weak I want to cry almost every day.
I have therapy and yet I can't talk about the things that frustrate me most because I don't like looking weak in front of people, and hate it when she always says I can't control everything. Believe me, I would love some things to change but in the end, all I want is for my dad to be my dad.
Instead, I get ""suicide is selfish"" when he knows I have chronic depression. Knows I've Sh. But it isn't what he believes in so it's wrong. I'm on so many medications I feel like a walking health experiment, believe me when I say I know pain. Every day I walk and smile like nothing is wrong when deep down I've called suicide hotlines more than a dozen times because if I was honest I'd go to a psych ward. 
I'm lonely, I've been homeschooled most of my life. I tried private school, it made my depression worse due to the extremely toxic staff in the school. I tried public school, but it made me extremely uncomfortable and the school constantly punished me for having diabetes and mental health problems. Making me apologize for not listening to someone that didn't know what they were doing with my insulin.
I live in an extremely Christian country and I have no issues with that except everyone has tried to make me feel bad for not being Christian. I'm Pagan, I have no hate for Christianity. I just can't handle the constant ""God does everything for a reason"" ""God won't put you through something you can't handle"" etc etc.
In the end, I just want to be happy but no matter what I do I want to end my life. I love my Mom, dogs, friends, and boyfriend but I feel like an asshole for talking about myself and how I feel, it makes it hard to explain anything when I can't help but wish it could go my way for just one day so I can breathe.

I am always last, he can't even listen to my triggers because that would hurt his feelings. He buys me stuff to make me feel bad for being upset when in reality he's the reason I'm suicidal... I want to go home, but I'm scared my dad will make my boyfriend leave me because he's so much... I just want to be happy, is that too much to ask? Am I meant to be this way forever?

i want to stop being depressed, but i love thinking depression thoughts because i feel so beautiful being ""told"" (in my body chemistry) im loving something or someone with depressing thinking. but i dont actually find fulfillment in it all, but keep finding the allure of ""i'll find that fullfillment just around the corner, with this thought, or the next one.....

like thats really hard.

stop depression, but give up a love chemistry and try live a ""normal"" life again, working making money socialising living the high life.

which cant happen, because if i try live that life, i cant be depressed, but depression makes me want that life, and feeds the thoughts and love for it.

i cant control them, i need help from a higher source, but the higher source is non existent in my realm of loving who i am.

stupid body hormones fighting against themselves.

its like im competing for my own love looking for a balance.

anyone feel the same?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/113gjr0/this_sucks_having_an_addiction_to_depressing/
My brain is always on and I just want peace.,1133f9k,wouldprefertostop,1676482096.0,7,1.0,"I spoke to my therapist yesterday about everything I'm anxious about. There is so much, and I just want it all to go away. I said one thing that I didn't realize meant something at the time, but I realized later that it sounded dark. And what's worse: I still mean it.

I have health anxiety. My dad basically passed on one side of the family that all gets cancer, and another side of the family that all seem to die early of heart failure. So I spend most of my life looking at my skin freaking out about new moles and overanalyzing every tiny pain or sensation in my body. On top of that, I have Chiari, which has created its own anxiety problems.

My life is so fucking exhausting. I don't know that it's hard—I think a lot of people put in more effort than me and a lot more people have it harder than me. I'm a white male that grew up in an okay area and I haven't had to suffer much hardship. But my life is just fucking exhausting. Kids, custody issues, health, mental struggles, exes, panic disorder, OCD, anxiety disorder, depression.

Every single day I wake up afraid of what's going wrong in my life. Constantly thinking about it. I can't turn my brain off. I don't stop thinking about it until I go to sleep. Every night I wake up at the same time and have to toss and turn in hopes that I can get more adequate sleep. I can't get any of it out of my head. I can't fix it, and I have to sit and wait for answers. 

I told my therapist yesterday: I just want a doctor to come in and say ""ah yes, you have all these problems in your life, here is the solution. And then for them to flip a switch and fix it all. I can't keep being patient and waiting for my problems to be taken down one at a time. I'm not wired that way.""

And I realized that I basically just described death. And I don't feel any different than I did yesterday. I still want that doctor to come in. Everything keeps coming to me all at once and I just want it to go away. And I keep telling people these things and they keep saying ""fix it this way, fix it that way"" and none of it ever provides a solution, just -maybe- mitigates some damage. I'm tired of waiting around for my health to just stop and I'm tired of feeling alone. I want my wife to not worry about me anymore and I just keep thinking I have to just make it 10 more years so the kids will be adults and can take care of themselves.

And I can't tell this to anyone because if I do, my ex won't hesitate to take my son away from me. And she has messed up at every turn in her life. Drug abuse and lazy. I can't trust her to provide for my son in my absence. But I can't keep getting into these crisis states or someone is going to see. I just want someone to just come fix everything. Nothing even fucking makes me feel better anymore. I force myself to work on projects because that's what they say is good for me. But all the problems are still there and I JUST WANT IT ALL TO GO THE FUCK AWAY.

My dad is a piece of shit and had 8 fucking kids and abandoned all of them and he was never there and all he passed on to me was shitty genes and I'm sitting here working my ass off for my son and he's just going to think I abandoned him by dying. I'm trying to keep going but it's so fucking exhausting. There has to be an end point where this all just stops and my brain finally turns off.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1133f9k/my_brain_is_always_on_and_i_just_want_peace/

I started doing stuff like this when I was 16 to try to get a boost in confidence and self-esteem. Now at 19, it doesn't matter how many guys I sleep with I will still think I'm the same fucking insecure guy. I just don't want to be alone anymore. I miss my ex, I saw him the other day and he apologized for the way he broke up with me. And gave a explanation. He said that one of our other friends at the time convinced him to break up with me instead of talking with me. Yes, both of them are fucking idiots. But I find myself constantly thinking about where we would be if we didn't break up. I'm supposed to take mom out for lunch in the afternoon, but I don't want to, but at the same time, I told her I would. I feel pathetic. When I came out,  all this started. I wonder how my life would be if I didn't. I'm scared that I won't find another job or go back to Best Buyy. I'm scared that when I graduate,  I won't find a job related to my major.

Several years later, it all came out the lies the cheating some of the fights were physical bewteen us alot of the time when I confronted him about things and Alchol was involved
I didn't think he could break me anymore but he did. Last year I wanted to die over knowing but not having proof of the cheating this year I got it and I cannot see myself for anything but worthless. What did she have that I didn't? Was it her body, because me and her knew eachother so we had alot in common I got done so dirty. All the texts and talks and lies and meeting up I was devestated I still am
I let him go yesterday. Wed be 8 years next month and it was for nothing. The nights I held myself in tears begging him to tell me why he wouldn't come near me why he couldn't give me what was needed and he told me it wasn't me.. That should have been it. I could take it all I could but telling another girl you love her after almost 8 years crushed me after I begged for months to stop just stop entertaining it other women. It's my own fault to. I spent last night with him gone most of his things to, and I cried all night holding his dam pillow wishing none of it happened wishing he never let another get that close to ruin me he's meant to protect me. I stared at myself today and I seen nothing but disgust. Im not fit I'm. Thin I'm not a model I'm not great i have alot of physical faults maybe that was a part of it. It had to be maybe I wasn't enough for him anymore in anyway. I stared at the little notes he once wrote me and I... I just broke. I'm so angry I'm so destroyed. His actions didn't just ruin him but me to we both lost our home but I lost my confidence my trust. I'm questioning the whole relationship. I bet he's texting her now telling her how great she is and I'm here shattered in pieces praying that I have the will to take myself out before it really hurts me and that it works this time. There was so much rage for a while now its all pain and tears. Why didn't he just leave why put me through that!! Why continue it for a year after I knew but couldn't prove it why not let me die that time why drag it out and put me through it months later all over again!!! 
Not even a sorry nothing!! No closure nothing I wish I could feel that like it didn't hurt at all. Ignore pretend he didn't exist. But that's not reality. It hurts, a little bit in me wants him to come home hoping praying... But he ruined it 8 years ruined for his selfish wants. All of this on top of what I already have outside of the relationship I can't do it anymore. I know he hates me for outting it all I know he does but what about what he done to me to. Why do I have to feel bad for saying the truth to while dealing with the heart break. He told everyone I was crazy, he belittled me so much all the time to anyone who'd listen including her so I told everyone the truth about them both and he's angry? He's hurt? I keep telling myself don't let it get to you don't go there... But then it's so silent and empty around me. I want to let go now I have lost so much so much through life and I can't keep up. 

Tldr : long term realtionship ruined by lies and cheating and other women some abuse also.

**My (25F) Living Situation with My Mother is a mess, and I think I need opinions. My mental health is suffering and I think I'm crazy.**  

  
Hi everyone;

I feel like I'm totally crazy or downright wrong. I also want to say that the exact time frames might be off, unfortunately, I suffer from memory issues likely due to my depression and other factors.  
This is a throwaway account, just off the bat. There are some details here and there that I'd rather stay anonymous for the time being, as they're generally quite sensitive.

I've spoilered anything I think might warrant a content warning and/or be sensitive!

I, as stated, 25F live with my Mother - 54 - and younger sister - 17.  
My upbringing has been a rather crazy one; while I was young my parents had a wanderlust and as a result, often travelled. It caused us to end up going on an 'extended' vacation to an island that we ended up living on for around 8-10 years, all told.

When we returned from that island back to the UK, I was severely bullied in the first school I went to. My culture and upbringing were completely different from those around me, and it left me a little in the dark about many things I should have possibly been aware of, at the time.  
I was moved school after something happened >!(I was molested by another student on school grounds, he claimed he was trying to kick me down the stairs, either way, very little was done about it) !<and my parents went nuclear. I was then moved to a new school after all the bullying and incident took place, but the damage was very much done. It doesn't help that the aforementioned also happened at the second school I went to, but it was far more swiftly and justly dealt with.

It took some years later to be diagnosed with a few issues, including severe anxiety and depression, suspected ASD, OCD and Borderline Personality Disorder.  
As a result of all these combined issues, plus a few others I don't really think warrant explanation - mostly physical issues - I was placed on disability after attempting to hold work three times and failing terribly. >!(I would spend most nights or pre-shift crying on the floor, in terror or absolute overwhelm over the stress of these jobs. It got to the point where I felt I needed the hospital because of the intensity of the panic attacks. It would often take me a few hours to come down off these as well. I was most certainly experiencing suicidal ideation at this time, as well as in my school years and did self-harm.)!<

I've been on disability for a few years now and medicated, and I have improved to the point of being able to talk to people and go out. However, I simply don't like doing it. It's incredibly uncomfortable for me to go outside and often takes all of my energy. So my answer is that I don't. I spent most of my time in my small single room on my PC doing odd ends here and there, talking to friends, enjoying games and working on my animating skills. My animating has been going wonderfully and a few places have expressed interest in hiring me when I am in a state where I can work properly.

This has caused a point of contention between my mother and me. She believes that at 25, I should be 'over' my issues by now and leading a better life than I am. She often mentions my cousin who as far as I know, has his own place and a kid, and he's only a year older than I am with a stable and rather difficult job. She hates that I order food and don't leave the house, or help with chores as often as I should. But most days I'm still in a constant battle with something, whether it's OCD, anxiety, or depression. While my meds help, they're far from foolproof. And with my poor memory, it's not uncommon for me to totally forget to take them at all.

She mentions being worried about my health since I don't move around much and eat poorly. I am overweight - 190 lbs, give or take and 5'2 - though have changed my diet to eat less within the last month and a half and have been losing weight as a result.

It's clear to me, and from what I can tell of my mom, she does not feel I'm progressing fast enough. I feel that she resents me for 'holding her back' and not having a life of my own, where I am not under her roof, as she already has my sister - 17 - to take care of, and she didn't have plans for that to include me at 25. **Should I be progressing faster? I feel like I'm stealing her life because my depression isn't healing quickly enough.**

All that being said, she has been pushing me to go out, do things, go on courses or leave the country by myself to pursue ""life"". She gets angry with me for getting food for myself and not eating the groceries she brings in, for not ""living"". But that is another can of worms entirely; unfortunately, the family is quite petty at times. We don't like to clean and will create a fuss if we think someone isn't pulling their weight. That applies to all of us, myself included, though I have pulled myself back significantly and don't leave my room other than to shower, use the bathroom and eat.

I want to clarify that I am not living in the house rent-free, and while I do some chores occasionally, I pay £600 a month in rent, which ""covers my utilities and food"" and whatever I have spare or manage to get from an animation commission I will probably spend on food delivery or games to occupy the rest of my time. I have asked her about paying her less for rent so I could save money, but she has pointed out that I am not good with money and will likely spend it on frivolous things since I don't save anything I do get now, so it's better to pay her it to help with rent than fritter it away. I honestly agree with this stance she has.

All that being said; am I totally out of order? Should I 'pull up my big boy pants' and get on with it? Am I unreasonable? Is my mother unreasonable? I have been so, SO uncomfortable in this house recently and I'm at my wits end knowing what to do. Am I just being whiny and should be happy for the situation I have?   
Unfortunately, the last straw was my mother going through my accounts to confront me with my spare spending since the beginning of 2023, so now I am seeking advice, opinions, thoughts, and anything. I don't know if I'm even being reasonable myself anymore. I just know that I'm miserable and want to be left alone. I talk to my friends occasionally about these issues, but I'm always wondering if they're biased toward me, as my friends. That's why I'm here now; I want the cold, hard unbiased truth of Redditors. I think I need it.

Please, feel free to ask me to clarify anything or give more details, I'll do so as often as I can. Thanks a lot in advance everybody.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/113b4a0/am_i_my_own_problem_should_i_be_trying_harder/

I start thinking maybe I should die,113f7hj,feng_the_man,1676513194.0,1,1.0,"Hi everyone. Before diving into details, I will provide a bit of context. I'm an Asian living with my family in my home country. My dad is an influential personnel in a state-owned bank so he got me a job there. I'm on the overweight side (1m74 and somewhere over 90 kg) but i'm relatively active (2 matches of football and 2 badminton session weekly).

Things started taking a bad turn on me last July when I broke up with my girlfriend. Apparently based on what she told everyone afterwards she wasn't quite fond of me, just following the peer pressure of having a family without actual development of feelings. Later on I found out she left me for someone with better financial background and better looking in general.

Work is also going bad. My task is to maintain relationship with foreign banks, institutions and organizations, translating during meetings and stuff. Mostly taken for granted though, there are people who are clearly favored and having a clearer path for promotion. It is how it is here. I quickly lost my motivation and started procrastinating work in general. It is just worthless when you work until 12 and barely being noticed. In December, dad found me a better position somewhere else in the bank, basically a fresh start. I was excited of the prospect knowing that work is finally taking a good turn and then 2 months later I received the news that I lost the opportunity cuz someone clearly can't keep his/her promises. Back to ground zero we go.

Things don't get better at home. My parents were dead serious about me needing to lose weights, and I have to admit they were right. I kept following my weekly schedule and once I follow a strict diet, my weight started to drop reliably. However, a month after the break-up, I twisted my leg in a badminton match which resulted in  a fractured ankle. I have to stop any sporting activities since then, and my weight is catching up again (I'm currently somewhere over 100). All the work-life stress started giving me eating disorder, so I can't seem to follow a strict diet to lose my weights again. Mom and dad are having none of it, keep on pushing my recovery so that I can start jogging again, which for them, is the only way to lose weights. 3 months after the injury, they kept talking so much that I one day gave up and gone running again, which worsen then injury and the doctor almost killed me. Now at home any occasion we spend time together (mostly during dinners), it's all about I need to put more effort on running when the injury's over. They don't understand the fact that I'm putting everything I have on the badminton court or football field cuz that's what interests me, not running. 

With everything stressing me out: a job that I don't want to do anymore, some worthless relationships that last 1-2 months when I'm bored, my parents who can't seem to understand a single thing about me, and my body weight keep on gaining, suddenly I started having this fucking need to put a bullet through my brain and end all this.

Have you ever been around friends and family, and their opinions are so opposite of yours that when you speak to them, they’re so dug into their belief that there’s nothing you can say to change their mind? It’s tenfold when that opinion/belief pertains to the way you live your life. 

It’s scary how predictable people are. If they looked at me, they’d see a spoiled lazy stoner who hasnt had a job for two and a half months. My mom even thinks I’m just bumming off her. But my depression is being caused by not having a job. It’s caused by waking up and feeling utterly useless. I wake up and if my life isnt spent serving some corporation that barely knows I exist, or it’s spent keeping up with the Jones’es, except it’s my own mom. I don’t want to have more than what I already have, but if I don’t look like I have ambition, you get overlooked for a lot of lifesaving things.

I feel like I’m becoming somewhat of a conspiracy theorist. I’m screaming about how other people cant aford healthcare and cant afford to live under a roof, without realizing that the more I siffer from this, the closer I get to being like them. I’m scared. But it seems inevitable. I’m so different from my surroundings that I’m invisible. They look at me like I’m a disgrace, yet keep on keeping on in their life, or at worse, complain to me about their problems.

But that’s the problem with depression…even if you have legitimate ambition, one misstep and you may find yourself like me, spiralling, broke, unemployed, lonely, and ranting on reddit to people who either don’t care or can’t help you.

Maybe I’m one of those people that just isnt cut out for modern day life…I feel so cold and numb toward everything. Food isn’t good, therefore I havent eaten. No job, so no reason to get out of bed.

My family is full of overachievers. My mom was top of her class in university. My dad too. My cousins work in FAANG companies with excellent pay. I am a disappointment to everyone. But most importantly, myself. I'm a useless person.

I'm literally not good at anything. And I know that I will never be good enough for anyone. I will only be a parasite to my parents. And I can't even kill myself because I'm a coward and because I can't do that to my parents.

I don't know who I am, I don't know what I want, I don't know why am I here and why should I want to be here... I feel like I can push myself thru the whole life no matter what because you can always make it work somehow... like a braindead zombie mimicking real people... but is it even worth it?

Is this an early stage of depression or there’s nothing to be worry about,113bggh,Known_Trifle_,1676502680.0,0,0.5,"I have two close friends who I can talk anything about. When I have negative feelings I share them with my two close friends and get over it. But I’m not a fan of sharing lots of negative thoughts as I think it could drain their energy as well.

Recently I started feeling really low about myself and having lots of negative feelings. I often get annoyed by small things and feels like I want to cry. Even though I haven’t cried in front of strangers so far it really shows in my face that I’m upset. 

The problem is I don’t feel like sharing how I’m really feeling these days with my close two friends. I feel like I’m being sucked into a black hole that no one can reach and help me and unfortunately I feel fine with it. 

I don’t have suicidal thoughts but I do feel like there’s no point of living the life anymore. Because I don’t have a relationship at the moment and I feel like I shouldn’t be having kids because it’s a big responsibility. I’ve been told that I’m beautiful by many guys but people usually don’t want to start anything serious with me because they think I’m lack of feminine vibes. For example I’m being told by people that I walk like a guy. So at this age(30) I feel like I’m going to stay alone (in the long term) for the rest of my life and since I don’t want to take a responsibility of a child on my own there’s no point of living this life anymore. 

I’m bit worried about the ‘black hole’ part. Is this an early stage of depression? Should I see a psychiatrist? Or else, as I’m aware of my own problems should I be able to solve this on my own.

Feel like a parasite, leech, etc. Get a job? Sure, if i could get over the anxiety and depression. Go to therapy? Can't afford it. Practice self love? Did that, didn't work. I'd like to cry it out, i think, but i can't even do that. The tears won't come. All i feel is just, some kind of anger, i guess. Sure, i could tell the people around me i'm hurting, but that'd only add on to their problems. I'm just so tired of myself. tired of feeling like this. I don't even know, or remember, if there's any other feeling than this. This is my life. It's unending pain. I'm tired. I want it to end. I hate feeling like this. Does it ever end?

I(17M) have no idea what i can do with my life, throughout my life i always been a fuck up and no matter what i can do i can’t change it. I tried everything to working out, studying, relationships, working at my job more but i Just can’t seem to find something I’m particularly good at. I keep messing up and hurting people around me and i can’t quite seem to forgive myself and my stupidity, the one only thing i have is most likely about to be gone and i have no idea what else i can do. I can’t speak to family about this as they would just say to “toughen up” and that they had it worse which is true, i sometimes hate feeling this way when they indeed did have it worse but they have a happy ending and as for me i do not see one.

After high school i don’t know what i should or can do as i don’t think i can do any of them. I just am tired, i don’t want to do this anymore, would rather just sleep for awhile, im tired of faking a smile when people see me, im tired of doing all this, im tired of pretending im fine when someone asks me if i am and saying yes so i don’t burden them. I don’t think I’ll be happy later on in life or find any enjoyment in it, it all feels like work even in things i used to find enjoyment in. It all feels like work.

No matter how hard i try i always seem to fuck shit up and i can’t seem to even try later in life, I’m sick of it and i just want to leave this feeling but no matter what i do, buy, eat, try i can’t seem to find enjoyment in it.

I just want to sleep for a while, god i fucking wish i could but i can’t but god i wish i could.

WTF DO I DO!!!!!!! I HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO LIVE LIFE AND I AM GOING MENTAL/DYING INSIDE,1134api,LifeIsOverrat33d,1676484191.0,2,1.0,"Right now I should be studying for an exam tomorrow but I can't muster it up within me to do it. I know I am capable of doing it, I actually already have a full degree from university but I'm not mentally able to right now. I graduated another university program about a year ago and got a degree I don't really care for. I've actually not really cared for anything for a long time. It's not like I don't have feelings I do and I do ""care"" about certain things but I don't care for this life, I only see a dark future ahead for me. 

After I graduated I fixed my resume and applied for about 70 jobs over the course of 8 months and they all rejected me. I got a few interviews that lead nowhere but thats about it. Even though I applied for 8 months 70 jobs isn't even a lot of jobs applied to I learned. I know a guy who sent 150 job applications and only got a interview for two of them. Beside the fact that searching for a job is soulcrushing, working in of itself seems so depressing to me. All that awaits me is having no time and slaving away at a job I give 0 fuck about.

The funny thing is that even though I have that ""time"" now, I can't do anything with it. Right now I am taking another course at university just so that I have something to do since I can't find any work and having a gap in resume make you look bad. The course im taking is of small interest to me but it gets me out of the house and makes me feel somewhat ""normal"" even though I know I am not normal. Right now I have the time to use for things I like but I have nothing to spend it on. My hobbies don't do it for me anymore and I no longer have any friends left since I had to cut out the last few I had from my life becasue they were toxic/no effort. My romantic life is a joke and always have been. My connection to my family is complicated and it's not a good one and so right now I have no social life at all.

I have tried so many things to find my place here in life but I am running out of energy/will and I feel like life is meaningless and too painful for me.

**I have tried therapy and mental exercises:**  
\-KBT-therapy.  
\- meditating.  
\-journaling.  
\-Visualising.  
 (All of it was useless and I don't do it anymore).

**General selfimprovement:**  
\-I go to the gym 5 times a week.  
\-I go for walks.  
\-I eat reasonably good/healthy.  
\-I don't smoke, do drugs and I don't drink unless its socialy but as I said no social life so no drinking. I do have a porn addcition though, due to loneliness.  
**I try to fix my sleep because its killing me:**  
\- having consistent sleep routine .  
\- no screen 1 hour before bed.  
\-walks at night to calm down.  
\-tried diffrent pillows and covers.  
\-tried drinking lavender tea before sleep.  
\-keep room cold.

Nothing is working though and my lack of sleep is fucking me up

  
**I have also tried going out of my comfort zone to try and change my life for the better:**  
\- Going out alone to do things you usually do with friends (swimming, walking, eating, traveling)  
\- Tried socializing/networking more, I went to pretty much every event I could go to during my first time in university to build connections   
\-I Tried online dating/tinder and went on some dates but most of the time (99%) it was just rejection and pain.  
\-I Tried directly asking out a girl I like at the gym (know this is kinda taboo but fuck it sometimes you have to try new things)  
\- Not overthinking everything and taking more risks 

I wanna go more in depth but I can't fit my whole life story on here but hopefully I am paintning a picture here. I am trying to find my place here in life but it's not working out. Most of my life have just been negative experiences with a few good ones to give you false hope. I don't connect with people easily and I don't enjoy life. I have been bullied, fucked over, taken for granted too many times in my life and the sad part is that many people have it much worse then me out there. 

I don't know what to do and I keep falling into a deeper state of : depression, apathy, nihilism, misanthropy, loneliness and hopelesness.

I don’t struggle with WANTING to shower, which is why I’m annoyed that by googling “feeling depressed after not showering for 2 days” only pulls result about “depression leads to not showering for extended periods of time” like no youre giving me the opposite of my query.

I struggle with feeling extremely depressed down to even suicidal if I don’t shower for more than 2 days, or when nearing those 48 hours. I’m currently on a new treatment for my anxiety and depression and it kills most thoughts 24/7 but when I’m nearing the time for showering it doesn’t matter if I took the treatment I will be so abysmally depressed, and incapacitated from doing genuinely anything, and I’ve tested it multiple times before thats literally only because of needing to shower. Im fine after the shower. But why? I often see other depressed people just like google said going weeks or months without showering yet this “I’m in need of a shower depression” is just so intense for me that if I attempted to not shower for a week I fear I would commit the act…. 

So how come I get hit like a truck by depression on only day 2 post-shower needing a new shower? When other depressed individuals go weeks without because of depression and its the opposite for me??

We live in a trailer, looking at homesteads I feel we will never afford. I workout and eat right but never lose any weight or get any stronger or faster. 
I’ve been diagnosed with ptsd (veteran) and depression, I’ve been on and off meds. VA is useless and even private healthcare is a joke.

They did help, but they had some other side effects I didn’t like, and I don’t want to be on pills for the rest of my life. My wife really wants me to get help, she sees me suffering. I even think it is making her depressed.
But I don’t see any way out. I’ll never get the promotion I’m working for, I’ll never get the house I’m trying to save for, I’ll never be able to make my family’s dreams come true, and I’ll never feel anything then what I am feeling now.

I've been prone to depressive episodes since I was a teen and I periodically end up feeling one that lasts a bunch of months and then I get myself so busy I can't think about it.

I've had CBT in the past and all I'm told to do is basically ""think happy"" and some practical advice to follow.

Now, I'm pretty skeptical of the stuff, but I've recognised I'm going back to my episode again, since a couple of months now.

But I do everything I was told to do, I exercise every day, I get out of bed, I have a strict routine, I keep my room tidy (mostly), make bed every day, shower every day, good food and lots of fruits and veg, vitamins, I walk 10k steps every day, I try to achieve my academic goals, I  cook everyday, I have some social interactions with my peers, I have developed hobby routines.

I tried so hard to give CBT advice a shot, I basically made it into a mission.
Yet, here I am, one more time, getting home at 6 after being out since 6am and lying on bed aimlessly for hours and feeling just void.

Is my entire life going to be like this? Am I just going to feel like this every year periodically at random for an indeterminate amount of time, only for it to be overshadowed by some other commitment or plan?
What am I doing wrong?

I’m currently in my second year of community college. I went last year for a semester, but failed almost all my classes and my parents were pretty disappointed in me.

I’m trying to fix myself by throwing myself into hobbies like going to the gym and starting to play the guitar.

So for context I am 22 year old male and just failed out of dental hygiene school. Getting into this program last year was the greatest accomplishment of my life. I spent 4 years taking classes to get into this program and just a week ago I was the happiest I have ever been, with issues before with anxiety and always being on edge. I was doing ao good in school and it is so hard as all my classmates struggle also but they got upset with me for not progressing while working with instruments and there was one instrument we were working with, and for more context for how difficult this program is you need to score an 80 to pass each exam in the clinic when working on actual patients. You get 3 attempts and I have passed every instrument until now the first attempt. Well this time my instructor said I caused tissue trauma because I made them bleed a very little in one area of the mouth but did good everywhere else. I never had any instructor fail me for this alone and it killed me. The second time I get a 73 somehow and now they put me under so much pressure making sure I know the stakes, telling me off for doing it incorrectly and tell me when to be there for the last retake 2 days later. I completely freak out those two days knowing I could be kicked out if I do not pass this time. I feel like they put so much pressure on me for this last attempt I couldn’t even focus on anything and when it came time I was shaking in fear of failing and they gave me no mercy and graded me at a 78. This was 2 hours ago from now and I haven’t stopped crying yet. The instructors had little remorse and just said reapply for the next class in the fall which I plan on doing but looking back I dont know how I could’ve handled this better I mean they give us little information to begin with and expect us to learn on our own and there have been several to be kicked out before me. It just reall sucks because this is the lowest I have been in my life and cant stop crying and my parents and family that I live with dont even know the situation I am in and are going to be so disappointed in me it makes me sick to think of telling them. I just dont know what to do I started googling jobs and stuff because I need to work somewhere full time until I am back in the program next year but I am really scared of telling my family as they have such high standards and do everything and pay for just about everything for me and dont charge me rent.

How can I help my depressed partner,1132f5z,Winter_meme_5419,1676479735.0,2,1.0,"Hello, my boyfriend is suffering from depression and he refuses to go to a doctor. I really don't know how can I help him, especially that he gets angry so fast ( really really short temper). And when he gets angry with me, he starts to threatening leaving me, and it's something that hurts me so much, and it happened multiple times.

For example yesterday, he was driving and we were discussing something. And we had totally different opinions about that thing, so he got angry with me because I kept insisting on my opinion on that stupid thing. When he got mad, he accelerated very quickly that he could've hit someone on the road.   
So when we came home, he started to yell at me because I was going to ruin his life. I didn't mean to make him angry, I swear, but he started to tell me that he going to leave if this ever happens again.

I don't know what to do, I really love him more than anything, I really want to help him to get through this depression, but this kind of things he tells me sometimes makes me lose my mind.

I don't know what to do, can you tell me what to do please ?  
Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1132f5z/how_can_i_help_my_depressed_partner/

After all, if you think about this every day, you can go crazy. I downloaded Reddit to somehow ease my condition. Sorry, I'm really tired, forgive me my whining. I'm tired..I want a normal life where I will be happy, I will have friends who can support me. I'm tired of being a psychologist for others, trying to help solve someone else's problem, knowing that I won't get the same help. After all, deep down I wanted someone to help me solve my problems as well. How insulting it was when I spoke to a friend about what was bothering me, and in response I got haha. I was very upset at the time and was once again convinced that no one from my entourage was interested in my problems. Now I am studying in another city, far from my family. I used to think my family was bad, but there were good reasons for that. But over time I forgave them, I can't hold a grudge against them forever. Every time I come home for the holidays, I don't want to return home so comfortably.I can't tell them about my problems, because I myself chose a place of study in another city, despite the fact that my mother told me that I would regret it. But my rebellious period took over me. I was already introverted, but things got worse with the move. It became difficult for me to go outside. Just the slightest thought that I will have to go out into society scares me. I'm already on the way to coming to terms with my life, that one day my head will rot from my shitty thoughts, but somewhere in me a little girl screams who doesn't want such a life for herself.

I am ex gambling addict who split up with my fiancée last year. I’ve been getting better slowly day by day but recently I been scammed and I no have 0 to my name and loads of debt which I hid from my family previously as they went mad when I come clean about the gambling. They think I have money from the house sale that was sold but I paid down the debt with the house money but as I lied about the level of debt in the first place it’s coming back to bite me know as I owe my family money which I used in this scam. The intention was to increase my income and it was not gambling related but Whilst I’ve been scammed I feel hopeless and I’m afraid to come clean as they went mad last time but I am tgat anxious it’s getting me in a dark place and last time I went to that place I attempted suicide so I’m trying to figure this out. As I said I was trying to better myself with a second job which turned out as a scam there was no bad intentions from my end.I will pay back every penny that I owe my family but I’m so scared about speaking to them due to how they reacted last time.

I feel like I don't understand the ""basics"" of anything. Literally, I don't understand a thing and I don't get why I can't. I don't understand anything about finance, and because I don't, I end up getting myself put into ridiculously horrible financial problems that just fuck me over. and I can google and research till the cows come home but I still can never understand what anyone/anything is talking about. 

This isn't the first time I've been in this situation either. It happens a lot. different scenarios and circumstances, but you think by now that I would have learned a thing or two. Or I try to do the right thing and be responsible and all that but I still end up just making things worse or getting screwed over and still having to deal with the outcome because...you guessed it. I signed up for it. I signed the paperwork, I said yes, and i chose who to do what.

I don't even know what to look out for in situations to make sure I DON'T get screwed. 

I know this sounds stupid and trivial and, 'omg life just sucks sometimes'. it's easy to pass it off as it is the way life is sometimes and there's no reason to get so worked up over it. But with everything in life. I just don't want to fucking do it anymore. I don't want to worry about the next time I'm getting fucked over, or scared to do the 'right' thing or the wrong thing. I don't like not being able to trust people that im supposed to be able to trust. Not everyone/everything has good intentions and honest ones. 

How the hell am I supposed to know the difference? I can't just know everything. I don't get people who do, who are good at those things. Am I just supposed to pay someone every time I do anything ever to tell me if I'm doing it right or not? 

I just make things worse. I never do the right thing it seems and I'm just tired of trying over and over again to just end up in the same place. in the same situation. In thousands of dollars in debt and no way to pay it off. Ever. I really just want this to end. I don't find life to be fun, or worth it if this is what I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life. Worrying about dumb shit that doesn't even matter in the long run. But I can't seem to let it go, or just be okay with the fact that I'm the reason there's a problem in the first place. 

How the hell does anyone just be okay with this?

People never listen to me and believe they know everything about what I should do meanwhile they dont even see past the very surface. Now I look out and see that all sucks. The world is just lukewarm grey sludge which people work in for the rest of their lives never achieving anything greater than materialistic gains. I dont know if there really is a bottom to the barrel. Or hell. If I even belong in society in the first place. If one needs drugs to live then I think the problem may be elsewhere.

I'm just so tired at this point like xd,1134ljr,theheavenshateme,1676484966.0,1,1.0,"So I had a suicide attempt almost a year ago. I chunked down 20+ antidepressants so that I could meet my end and give an end to the miserable person I am with the stupid amounts of suffering. Obviously, it didn't work and I got hospitalized. The doctors said an hour late to the hospital and I would've had a heart attack and would've died and blah blah. So it's like at the moment I was delighted because knowing that you were about to die is the scariest shit ever and giving an end to the feeling of impending doom is really awesome. It's been like 4 months since I started antidepressants and it did help indeed but just a little bit. I still wake up and can't sleep for hours every day. I sometimes see extremely terrible dreams and wake up at night with an awful panic attack. And every day still feels like a fucking shitshow that doesn't have any meaning and it is miserable and if it ended it might just be for the better because it's just so empty and meaningless. My therapist said that I should focus on my school like studying a lot go outside. I've been trying my hardest to study and do positive things as much as possible with all the force I have. She told me that it would get better eventually with time if I did these things. But it just doesn't. Like I've been trying so hard for so long but that terrible feeling of emptiness and that feeling of always being on the edge and always being alert and being hyperaware. It just never goes away. There was this one girl that I loved more than anything and I really wanted a future with her a beautiful family a few kids a beautiful house and just happy things. She told me that she would be with me in these hard times of mine but she just left as well. All of my dreams collapsed. I don't see any point in my life nothing gives me joy and I always overthink everything so I have a 7/24 headache and get really nauseous when I eat. Living is just like torture for me and I just wanna know if was I just born to suffer like this and if it's not the depression the anxiety and that stuff. Is it all just me ? Like there is no cure?

He just started going to therapy and last night he told me he doesn’t feel anything, doesn’t think I actually love him, thinks badly on himself. I know it’s the depression talking.

It’s just hard to get him to believe everything I’m doing is genuine and if he’s in the headspace he is in I can’t make him think or feel otherwise. 

How can I help? What are extra things I can do or say so he knows I’m here, love him, and am supportive and that  he can lean on me.

Fell back into crippling depression after 10 months of success,1133ryd,Low-Willingness-1534,1676482848.0,1,1.0,"Last year I fell into a crippling depression that lasted 6 months, I failed a semester, withdrew from everyone, showed up to work only half the time. I could not function and all I wanted to do was random drugs every other week, drank heavily nightly. I spent all my time in bed or walking my dog.

I sought therapy. I went to weekly therapy and tried medication. I was on bupropion for 8 months and it seemed to motivate me to do better. I took a semester off of school and focused on myself. I felt happy, like I had plans and a fresh start. 

I barely passed last semester, while still taking bupropion. I couldn't tell if it was working anymore or not. I increased my dose and felt worse. I stopped taking it with the guidance of my doctor. I continued to take prescribed adderall for ADHD. Eventually even that could not motivate me to do anything, I would just feel energized mentally but not physically. 

Now I am 5 weeks into the semester.  I avoid classes. I only go to half, one I haven't been to at all. I must graduate this semester, it's my only chance. But the depression is back, and I don't want to take bupropion again knowing it didn't do anything for me in the end.

I hate my life, I hate where I am, I hate that I have so many nice things I've earned for myself, but cannot enjoy them. I had a functioning routine for 10 months and it's gone. I felt happy and motivated to do art, read, go outside, etc. I have been spending days in bed again, smoking tons of weed and trying to ignore that I really, really want to die. It's like a voice in my head repeating I want to die, but at the same time, another voice telling me not to do that. 

I have CPTSD from an abusive relationship, fried my brain with tons of drugs, concussions, etc. I don't know if I will ever be the same or be able to function. How do I get back out of this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1133ryd/fell_back_into_crippling_depression_after_10/

I read (or heard, i don’t remember) somewhere that people who are depressed are, more often than not, highly intelligent (more than the average people) because they understand how the world works and they understand how everything is fucked. Which makes it incredibly hard to have hope when you can see and feel all that. Since we understand more, we feel more and thus, hurt more. So next time you feel like you’re shit and hopeless (which, sorry to tell you, will happen again) know that you’re part of us smarter people (😎). If you’re smart enough to feel depressed, you’re smart enough to find help and figure something out to make the most of your life. That’s why im still here. If i can still have hope, you can too.

I’m scared of the fact that my parents want me to get a driver license next year since but just the thought of it make me anxious. I’m scared of being on a bus or walking home without someone I know. I’m scared of the things my ”friends” do, like drinking, smoking, drugs, or relationships. Especially relationships.

And I’m scared of growing up.

Bad household situation,1130k04,househousebad21,1676474773.0,1,1.0,"So basically my older brother is 28 years old, almost 29 and he’s basically never worked a day in his life. Currently, right now he doesn’t even shower, hasn’t even brushed his teeth in over a year, and basically does nothing besides laying on the sofa all day and occasionally farting. Not to sound disgusting but because he never showers, you can kind of smell a faint shit smell due to him farting constantly and never showering. It’s honestly disgusting and infuriating. My mother says she’s worried and stressed about the whole situation but she doesn’t know what to do about it. We also have a puppy which needs to be taken to the toilet in the garden regularly throughout the day, of course, he’s the only one in the house and most of the time he can’t even be bothered to take the puppy to the toilet. He just can’t be bothered to do anything and it really pisses me off. When I’m not at work, I’m the one who is mainly taking the puppy out to the toilet regularly because he never does it.

He also regularly orders takeaways such as large pizzas. He also keeps ordering energy drinks constantly and drinking them on a daily basis. Whenever my mother tells him to have a shower or brush his teeth he starts to get angry, like he doesn’t want to do anything. It’s seriously annoying. He is with the mental health team and they’ve offered multiple times for him to move out into assisted accommodation. This means he would be able to move out and move on with his life. Obviously this is something he’s not doing. He’s clearly not taking the opportunity to move into assisted accommodation because then that would mean he’d have to actually get off of his ass and eventually get a job, do his own cooking and laundry, etc. It’s honestly depressing. I don’t want to be mean to him or anything but he’s clearly not normal and has some severe mental issues or something.

I’m currently 21 years old and I work part time in retail in a supermarket. I’m currently deciding whether I should go to University or not, as I have been accepted for Uni and I have a place for it this year. I’m just currently researching into the course to see whether it’s worth it or not. If I decide not to go to Uni I’m going to get full time retail work, and then eventually move out, most likely by going on the housing list. At least I’m trying. I currently have around £3700 saved in my bank account. I do my own laundry, shower daily, pay £150 a month to my parents, look after the puppy and sometimes help around the house. The difference is I’m actually trying. 

We’re also cramped in this house. We both have a 10 year old sister who still doesn’t have her own room and still has to sleep in our parents room because of all of us living in this house. I have no hope this situation will ever change, I can’t do anything to change him, I’m just continuing to focus on myself and my own plans. I don’t understand how he can sit inside the house all day long not doing anything. He has no aspirations or goals or anything. I personally want to improve my life. We’re like the complete opposite from each other. I’m doing things whilst he’s doing literally nothing. It’s like he thinks he can just sit here for another 10 years and never work or do anything, it’s a fucking joke and I’m beyond fed up with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1130k04/bad_household_situation/

I feel like everyone around me have reached some important milestones in their lives, and I haven't. When I hear about marriage, sex, relationships, and children I become unglued because it bothers me, and the sad thing is because I'm in my mid-30s and I feel like there's something terribly wrong with me. I have other friends who I hang out with that I feel comfortable with them, and I could be myself around them, and not to pretend to be someone that I'm not.

I've had suicidal thoughts for over a decade (24/F) but they're just getting worse. My days are empty, but as night rolls around all I can think about is ""just do it, just do it, just fucking do it"", especially when I'm cutting, it's so hard to hold back not slicing my veins. The thought of me being alive makes me physically nauseous, and my whole body has this tight, anxious, uncomfortable energy holding back from killing myself. I'm absolutely terrified to die, but the older I get and the more I fall behind, the more I'm leaning towards suicide is my only option. And I'm trying to get my brain to accept that. I'm also preparing for when I finally feel ready, I have so many notes I need to write and so much shit I have to deal with. So anyways, the reasons holding me back from killing myself make me feel like I shouldn't be in hospital.
I've been admitted before, but I had a psychiatrist to admit me. I got to skip the whole waiting room and being interrogated by a million people who don't truly know or care step. Unfortunately she moved away so I don't have that anymore. My psychologist now wants me hospitalized, but unfortunately she can't do much except call the hospital, let them know her concerns, and can have me taken by cops to the hospital if I want. But (I had a SUPER bad year in 2020, it took months of fighting to get hospitalized) last time we did that I was turned away every time. Nobody took me seriously. Hospital last time definitely helped, it sucked and it's lonely but also gave me a break from all the things that were making me want to kill myself. I kinda stabalized in there. 
Anyways, should I even try? Am I even bad enough to go? Or am I just being a whiny baby.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/112omkc/considering_going_to_the_psych_ward_but_im_really/

If she did decide to stop taking them, and she relapses, I don’t know how long I’ll be able to stick around…

It all started in the summer of 2018 I had a well-paid job, I was successful and wealthy in my 23 years, but at some point in my life changed and I had to move with my wife to another city which is 1800 km from mine, I longed for my parents, longed for my friends who are almost gone and at that moment I realized that I need something to occupy my head to just think less and decided to stream on Twitch.   
I was very excited about the idea, at first it was hard because you could sit for 8 or 9 hours on a broadcast and no one would even visit you, but after a while I created my little community which helped me not to feel lonely, I really appreciated them, they were not just my viewers, they were my truest friends and here is a year, two with my wife relationship gets worse and worse, I try to keep it, but this is the feeling when you chase something to keep, and she does not care. That's what happened to me.  
Last spring I felt a complete emptiness, I had no desire to keep going, I woke up every morning and thought, ""Why? Why did I wake up?"" I ended up living like this for about 5 months and decided that I needed to change my life and that this whole situation would only destroy me more.   
I pulled myself together and we divorced, even though we had been together for 8 years and lived together for 6 years.   
As I was packing, I realized one thing: all I had gained in 27 years was two bags of clothes and a computer. It was very hard to leave, I sat in the car for two hours, wondering whether or not to go. But in the end I took a chance and came to my hometown.  
Maybe it's pure chance, but the antidepressants my doctor prescribed started working the moment I moved back in.

Due to my isolation I became more and more bland to the point where I'm just living for the hope that things get better, I am no fool and I know that only I can help myself but for some reason I just don't want too. I never really share anything with anyone which is weird considering I'm sharing this with potentially 940,000 people lol, recently I went to a party for the first time in ages but since i've been absent socially for so long I barely had anything to say to anyone and I just left early. I love psychology and all things to do with mind and feelings, most likely because I want to understand more about why I feel this way. Although the more I learn, the more I become a slave to these feelings and urges to isolate or commit suicide. I've recently starting cutting myself again but I don't even know why, I'm just simply doing it. I probably skipped over a few key points that should of been at the beginning, but I figure if you made it this far you won't mind me saying it now. I've always been the guy people don't mind being there, never necessarily unpopular more like insignificant/invisible which has been the case majority of my life so I decided to test this theory when I went into isolation. I didn't shut off anyone, I simply stopped asking people to talk or hangout and to my expectations not a single person messaged me or asked me to hang out for a whole 6 months. After this I decide to message a few people two out of the three people thought I had literally died (assuming I killed myself because a lot of the people knew I was depressed) the only person who didn't assume I was dead was because I went to school with them. This really nailed into my head that no one cared about me apart from my immediate family, I was smoking a lot of weed (about every night for 3 years straight and still do) which at first of course was helping as it repressed hurtful memories and turned my rageful self into a more calm and relaxed version who kept all his problems tightly inside of my head. I'm very insecure about a whole number of things and have anxiety to the point were a lot of the times I'm faced with a big change I would often rather kill myself then do what I needed to do, obviously I did persevere considering I'm writing this right now but the thoughts are constant and have a hard grasp on my life. I'm often advised to be a lawyer because of how well I can argue a point, but the downside to that is I have a huge negative bias which in percentages would be around 95% negative to 5% positive and it just doesn't seem to change. I feel awful all the time and whenever I feel happy it disappears swiftly, I can't even tell if this is how everyone feels anymore and that life is just not worth the struggle of living just to get the ten second hit of serotonin after a week of misery. I'm not sure if anyone will read this in full or even at all but I am truly grateful for anyone who will listen to my story, even if it is a little messy (sorry it's 1am and I haven't had much sleep in the past month). I realise my question or query isn't exactly enough to determine what I actually want help for but I don't really know either so any advice is much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/112wtul/ive_been_depressed_for_a_while_and_nothing_seems/

I'm Pissed,112wozr,Adventurous_Assist74,1676463448.0,1,1.0,"I'm so, so angry at this disease. I've had struggles with depression in the past, but nothing like the latest crisis. A little recap:

I was obese. I started dieting and working out. I discovered a passion for bodybuilding I didn't know was there. I lost weight, built an attractive physique (with lot of room for improvement) and was feeling great. It was the 1st time in my life I was proud of my body, nevermind the achievement.

Then, out of the blue, depression knocked me down, quite literally. I went into a near vegetative state. I couldn't get up, sleep, cry, shower, brush teeth, read, watch tv, basically I could do nothing. If someone got close to me, I had a panic attack. I've never experienced anything this strong in my entire life. The only thing capable of moving me, was hunger. Lots of it. I went 2-3 days without eating anything and when the hunger was overwhelming I was able to get up. The best I could do was order the 1st thing I came across in a delivery app (unsurprisingly, junk food), perform basic hygiene while I was waiting, eat as if there would be no tomorrow and return to bed. This for over a year.

The outcome was quite predictable: I've lost all the muscle I built, gained weight, surpassed my worst, I got morbid obese (on top of losing job, spouse, and will to live, but that's a story for another time). I started treatment, improvement came by drips. Once I got minimally well, I returned to the gym. It has been 2 months. I still have a long journey before turning into a functional human being again. 

One would think once I got in touch with something I love, it would make things better. I certainly did. That's not what has been happening. 1st it's the panic attacks, the price for getting out of the house I guess. Then, it's this rage. I'm angry, pissed, furious, outraged for what this disease has been putting me through.

I see the people who trained in the same gym back then, and how much they improved. Instead of being happy for them, I'm angry! They are a mirror, of sorts, of how much I could have physically improved. All I can see is the time I've lost. It's infuriating. Were it up to me, I would have never stopped working out. And on top of that I'm starting a lot worse than last time. It'll be 2-3 years for me to be thin again. I'll have a load of skin issues. I have fat on the armpit, chin, pubic region, everywhere.

I'm feeling uber ugly, demotivated, and the least sexy guy on the planet. I take enough pills to make any drugstore jealous. I've lost a load of time to this disease, it's nowhere near the end, and I'll have to spend a load more of time just to ""reverse the damage"".

So, I'm really angry because all of this. And this outrage is making everything worse! If you have anything to say you believe that might help, please do. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/112wozr/im_pissed/

Stopped taking my meds for a while. I’m thinking it would probably be good to start taking them again but I’m wondering if it’s safe?,112qde0,Stag_beetle1229,1676438667.0,3,1.0,"So for context, I take a few different medications. I stopped taking them without consulting my doctor because they were making me really nauseous, to the point where I was pretty much always feeling like I was on the verge of throwing up and it was really disrupting my daily life.

 I tried to tell my mom this a few times, and she told my psychiatrist. He made some changes a few times, like changing my dosage and took me off some of my medications. And that didn’t really help. Tried to tell my mom again and eventually she was just kind of like “sorry, that sucks :/“ so I was like okay she’s not helpful.

My psychiatrist appointments are typically a few months apart, and in that time I just decided to stop taking them. I didn’t consult her about this because if she knew I didn’t want to take them anymore, she would go out of her way to ABSOLUTELY make sure that I took them. Medications have been something I’ve dealt with all my life, me not taking them is just kind of something that’s not really in the picture. But, I stopped taking them and honestly, I felt fine. Like completely fine. Like I’m still hella anxious and depressed, but it’s not any different than when I was on meds.
It’s probably been a little under a year since then. I’m still okay.
But I don’t like having secrets and I’m really scared about how mad she’ll be if she finds out. So I want to know if it’s safe if I start taking them again? What if one day I have to take them, and something goes wrong since I’m not used to it anymore, and she finds out?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/112qde0/stopped_taking_my_meds_for_a_while_im_thinking_it/

The memories of the one who suffered, the one who failed and the one who was abandoned. I tried to run, but I got caught almost instantly and dragged back to suffer even more. I tried to be strong and challenge the future, but the optimism always gets killed one way or another. Be it coincidence or life just watching me suffer, I  can't escape this torture. It is to the point now that if nothing bad happens to me today, I just suffer from some sort of mental breakdown, be it anxiety or a panic attack. 

I know I keep saying I will give up now. But I stupidly try and fight it, every day, I fight in this hell. Always drowning in a sea of people. Always hiding my thoughts to make others comfortable, always making decisions based on others' opinions rather than my own.

How do I get help?,112rmv0,Flat_Definition6399,1676443403.0,2,1.0,"
I am a 15 year old boy in highschool. The last 2 years of my life have varied from unsatisfying to downright miserable. I’m unhappy with all my friends (which there aren’t many) and think they’re all annoying. I find it impossible to make new friends or even make casual conversation with someone I want to become friends with. And talking to girls? The idea of getting a girlfriend at any point in life seems like a silly fairy tail. I may have a total of 3 female connections in my life. People always say to reach out and put yourself out there. Easier said than done. On top of that I have no hobbies or anything I’m good at. Even video games (which I spend most of my free time playing) I suck at. I have been a straight A student in the past and so it feels like everyone (especially my parents) have insanely high expectations for me. I am about to go into a year of 4 APs and 2 honors, and expected to get all As.the work has been piling up, and I’ve been procrastinating. I feel like i just can’t compete with the other students anymore. It feels like nothing is going right, and I feel like these last 2 years of highschool are the last chance I’ll get to turn thins around before I go into the real world, adding a timer to fix my life. Oftentimes I’ll just think to myself “what’s the point of living?” Everyday I feel lonelier and more depressed. What would be the point of living? Just to work all day and then be lonely the rest of your day? Your whole life? Anyway, all that’s to say that I need professional help. The problem is, I can’t tell my parents I need that. They’re super intrusive on my life, and would insist on me just praying to God, or at least to listen to me talk to a therapist, which I’m not willing to do. I don’t have a debit card, I can’t pay for online help. What do I do??????",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/112rmv0/how_do_i_get_help/
I love them so much that I'm willing to give in to the darkness for the sake of their happiness.,112pfs8,Last-Pipe7655,1676435390.0,3,1.0,"Gosh... where do I begin...? I mean, I guess I'll try to be as simple as possible.

I'm a first-time mom with my partner. We have a beautiful little nugget in our lives that we both adore. She seems to always make us smile when we are down, but... for me, it feels like a facade to keep them both happy.

I have clinical depression and social anxiety that's horribly crippling. I don't really understand why I have this self-hatred problem... I've had it since I was a child. I always blame myself for all the negative things because I feel like the cause of everyone's pain. Let me explain.

I had 3 dads in my life. All of them left without reason except for the 3rd dad. He had preyed on me since 9, and when I hit the age of 26, he had hurt me. I thought he loved me, I thought he loved my mom, but he hurt us all... I feel like if I didn't exist, this wouldn't have happened, and my mom would still be married happily. 

I've been with my partner for 8 years. He's been through so much with me over the years, and a lot of emotionally painful things happened while I tried so hard to fight for my life, I was highly su1c1dal years ago. I wanted to unalive so badly because I hated myself so much. I feel like if I didn't exist, he could have had a better partner that he would have a better life with.

We struggle now every day because my family all packed their bags and left us in the rental dumpster heap of a nightmare place. One by one, they left. The last one was my mom, who I had thought I could trust. She left because she didn't want to be here anymore, she left the next day, inviting the 3rd dad who hurt me, my brother who hates my existence and his partner over in the house to help her pack. I feel like if she had never given birth to me, she'd be much happier.

I love my partner and my child so much... I don't want to unalive, I want her to be there for my partner and i's wedding one day... I want to see her grow up to be an incredible woman... I want to be there for everything, I want to smile on a porch watching our grandchildren run around in a yard while I hold my partners hand, rocking in mismatched rocking chairs and tell him;

""You know... we suffered so much... but through all the pain, shone a light of hope. I'm so glad we made it through the darkness. I love you so much. Thank you for believing in me.""

I want to tell my daughter that I'm so proud of her for the woman she turned out to be. That I've always been so proud of her, and how much I love her, and always will. I want to give her and my partner a life better than what I had. I want them to smile and be happy.

I want to stop feeling like the cause of their pain. I want to feel like I am hanging on because I am useful, that I serve a purpose. I don't want to feel so useless anymore... I want to stop hating myself so much... 

I feel like they deserve better than me.

Today was the first day that I truly needed to cease to exist.,112pdwg,AnarchyUnscripted,1676435202.0,3,1.0," Well, here we go.

Like every Tuesday, I attended a session with my psychologist. I was emotionally normal, neither very happy nor angry.

To understand, I will detail a bit about my history. I am the stereotype of a somewhat introverted virgin boy who spent much more time than necessary playing video games and jerking off, to the point that I have unlocked certain levels of perversion. The most important thing about this is that you know that I have no self-esteem. Simply put, I hate myself because I am the one to blame for feeling the way I do. Since I was a child, I have always infantilized myself, despised myself, and felt inferior to others. I feel like I never truly found happiness. I can't remember a stage in my life where I felt like I was happy. Maybe it's just my pessimistic view, but I've always felt the same, always hated myself. Always despised myself.

I started therapy in 2021, exactly in March, due to developing a case of anorexia nervosa (I'm afraid to swallow, and I still can't do it naturally to this day). But that was just the tip of the iceberg. The reality is that I should have started many years before.

After finishing high school, I didn't know what to do with my life. In my country, university is relatively affordable, so it's normal for many students to go through different careers before finding the right one. In 2018, I pursued a degree in chemistry, which I abandoned without much difficulty.

Not knowing what to do with my life, during a conversation with a family member who was criticizing my cousin about her nursing career. She said, ""takes a few hours, barely has to study."" In my head, I said bingo. Just what I need,

— I like biological sciences (it was the modality I did in high school) ✓

— In my childhood, I dreamed of being a doctor ✓

— Few hours of study mean more time to play video games and jerk off ✓

In 2019, everything was incredible. I pursued my nursing degree with good grades and without major difficulties. I felt amazing, to the point that I threw a party with my friends at my house for my birthday (something I had never done before and haven't done again). Three months later, the COVID pandemic hit my country. A mandatory quarantine was established that forced people to be locked up in their homes. There was no other possibility but to do virtual classes, but as I said before, I'm the classic video game boy, and what does that mean when you're on a PC? VIDEOGAMES!!!!!. I don't remember when, but after just a few weeks, I stopped attending virtual classes. I had stopped without realizing it. I uttered these words: ""I have to be a man and face the consequences. I can't be depressed about this."" Like an idiot, even to this day and for the rest of my life, I will remember those words.""

My 2020 was simply a loop. I don't have memories of anything. It was a completely wasted year. Days and nights playing video games, masturbating, and watching series and movies. I called it the worst year of my life. Poor idiot, I didn't know what was waiting for me.

In 2021, in February more precisely, I had a very strong peak of anxiety. I remember one night where, while I was watching Snyder Cut: Justice League, I felt like I was going to swallow my tongue. I couldn't even drink water. My parents weren't at my house, but when they arrived they saw me particularly affected. That same week I started therapy.

Those first few months passed, I was excited to start my career again. I was finally going to get my life back on track, but as always, I find a way to be my own worst enemy. To return to the state where I feel like I do now, desolate.

I was at my lowest point, and my ""friends"" (incredibly, although I am a solitary person, I have many friends, (or at least I considered having many friends) began to make jokes about my career, about the dirtiest part of it. I was very weak emotionally and emotionally. It affected me a lot. If my opinion of myself is shit and worthless, obviously that of others will always be worth much more. That generated a terrible discomfort for me. It was particularly tough one night when we were playing Gartic Phone and one of my friends made a drawing of me cleaning an ass saying I hate this job.

I couldn't live, I couldn't touch my notes because I felt it was a waste of time. I struggled with this feeling for months. I wanted to quit, I wanted it all to end. I wanted to stop studying. I couldn't take the stigma anymore. I looked everywhere not to waste the time invested, the investment that my parents had made, but I couldn't. I couldn't take it anymore.

And in September 2021, it happened. After my first practices, and I'm not sure today if I really liked them or not. I decided to tell my psychologist that I didn't like them. I had waited precisely after the practices for this moment. It was exactly September 18, 2021, that I decided to quit. I told my psychologist to get her approval, and the hardest part was still missing. I remember a question she asked me, in tears:

— Do you feel that if you tell your mother you want to quit, will this be over?

I don't remember breaking down in tears the way I did that day. I never did it again. But I answered yes.

I began my march home. I cried all the way, about 1 mile walking. I remember every moment of that morning, every sensation. It was so far the hardest moment of my life.

When I arrived home, my mother saw me visibly affected. When I told her, she understood me. I never told her the truth about what had happened, and probably never will.""

As always, I managed to avoid facing the consequences, my parents hardly asked any questions. I thought everything was over, but as always, I was wrong.

From there, my life went completely downhill. I hardly ate, I became a total NEET, all my nights were spent playing video games and watching movies and series. I hated having to have dinner with my parents. Adding to my deplorable state, the economy of my house fell apart. I felt, in my own words, subhuman, something akin to an animal, undeserving of anything but rejection.

I had never worked before, I was very scared. The following months were an emotional rollercoaster. I fought with my mother many times. I cried just as many times. It was around this time that I realized I had lost almost 10 kg. My house had become a living hell.

That's how I entered 2022. With a huge resentment towards my mother, towards myself, and towards life. I hated everything, lived in constant fear. Fear of the future and fear of her. January was particularly the worst. My ""friends"" were available day and night, so it was a completely crazy month. My mother was not able to tell me that she needed me to work, and I had no idea what to do, because I didn't want to accept that I would have to work.

In February, she got me a part-time job at a business near my house. The pay was low, and still is, the job is dirty. I have no labor rights, no medical coverage, nothing. But for someone with no useful skills like me, no education or contacts, it's the only thing I can aspire to.

And it was also around this time that I decided to pursue my other passion, which was history. It was a tough process, as I felt I was destined to fail, but I still started a history degree in 2022 to become a professor. I consider myself good at explaining and simplifying concepts.

I made it through 2022 with a completely overpowering feeling, I felt like my decline had finally ended. I tried not to think about it, not to question whether what I was doing was really what I liked. I still had a lot of fear of going back to my previous state before my job. I kept the secret of what I was studying as best I could. I hardly mentioned it. But I finally felt like I had a future. And I reflected that with an extremely positive, upbeat, and confident attitude towards others. I antagonized my mother in all aspects of my life, therapy, friends, relationships. I once again believed that I had overcome my self-destructive phase, that now all I had left were years of studying what I liked and that the ghosts of my past would not come back to haunt me.

Fortunately, things went well for me. I made friends in college, and was even able to muster up the courage to ask a girl out on a date (something I had never done before and thought would be impossible for me). I eliminated every possible reminder of nursing, even suppressing it from my mind. To this day, I am afraid to step foot in hospitals. I took the path of denial and hid the issue under the pillow. I couldn't accept that the main reason I had given up was that I had been weak in front of people I thought cared for me. How could I deserve anything other than unhappiness if I wasn't strong enough to face criticism and move on?""

All of this leads to what happened to me. A week ago, while we were having dinner, my father made a comment about the economy of my country and how I should do some kind of job. As you can imagine, the topic of what I should or shouldn't do with my life is an extremely sensitive issue. In my head, he was questioning what I was studying. I took it terribly. I told him I hated those comments, so I got up and left. I had an outburst of anger. I wanted to break everything, I thought about going out and shouting everything I felt. How difficult it had been to choose a new career, to start from scratch (in part because they wanted me to.) Just the thought of going back to the previous state terrified me.

My mother hasn't spoken to me for a week. That's her way of showing her anger towards me. Today, February 14th, I talked about it with my psychologist. I explained what had happened and how I felt about it. We were talking about how I would never forgive myself for abandoning that career. I saw (and still see) my shitty job as a kind of expiation. I am constantly paying for my sins. I am extremely hard on myself in everything. Those who have low self-esteem like me may understand me. Choosing at random, leaving during 2020, to come back and leave again is something I simply cannot accept. I cannot accept my own stupidity.

Today, talking about how hard I was on myself, and how I couldn't forgive myself, she (my psychologist) questioned why it is so hard for me to forgive myself for something that happens a lot. I replied that I simply couldn't, I couldn't forgive myself, to which she returned asking,

— Don't you forgive yourself for leaving, or don't you forgive yourself for leaving something you liked because of other people's comments?

At that moment, I collapsed. I died inside, because deep down I know she's partly right. Don't get me wrong, I love what I'm doing right now, and I love the idea of teaching what I like, but I simply have no answer to that question. I am defeated, simply broken. As I was walking home and watching couples enjoying beautiful moments, I had my head spinning, completely clouded. I thought about committing suicide and ending it all right there. I don't feel capable of dealing with the idea that I abandoned something that, at least in part, I liked. However, I was not able to end it all, I repeated to myself to please gather the strength to jump under a bus, that I did not want to face that pain, that feeling of existential abandonment. Almost like a parallel to that September 18, 2021, I walked home again, but this time without crying.

The only thing I felt in that moment is wanting to cease to exist, to sleep for an eternity. I feel like I've lost my way, right now I'm completely melancholic. I went to bed as soon as I arrived. I needed to disconnect from this plane.

I woke up with a terrible feeling, as if I had done something horrendous. My head is spinning and I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't feel like doing anything, I'm not hungry, I'm not sleepy, I don't feel like playing video games, I don't feel like studying, just sleeping and forgetting that I exist.

Right now, I have no idea what to feel. I feel that, maybe, the way to forgive myself is to pick up something I used to enjoy doing and abandoned due to external criticism, disdain for what I was doing, fear, and emotional sensitivity. Maybe that's the answer. But I'm terrified of facing my parents about it. And I don't feel like quitting what I'm doing right now.

I want to find a way out of this mental loop, this feeling of feeling like an idiot, but there is no easy way out.

I don't want to be mistaken, this is not a suicide and/or farewell letter, I'm too cowardly to do it, but when I woke up, I felt the need to write down my thoughts and have strangers read them. I needed to finally be 100% honest about what I feel. Because I don't feel capable of talking about it with anyone. Not with my parents, not with any of my ""friends.""

At this moment, I feel an immense desire to cry, but I am not able to. I know I'm not thinking clearly, but I have to continue with this anguish. I'm afraid of knowing that I'll have to live with this. I have to face it, I have to take real responsibility for my stupidities. I have to make a decision and face this deep problem that I feel and that I have been ignoring for so long. I hope I am capable.

I hope to find comfort if someone reads this and identifies with it. Please feel free to say whatever you want in the comments. I just believe that nothing can hurt me more than what I've done to myself.

Follow your dreams. Don't be too hard on yourself. Be happy at any cost because it's the only thing we can aspire to in this terrible world.

We still fucked a few times after that but it was purely physical. Lately she had been treating me like an option. I know this makes sense since we broke up. It still made my chest hurt. She had been talking to a boy for a bout a month and today he came to her with a poster and they are officially dating now. This coupled with my addiction problems just fucked it up in my head.

"I'm Pretty sure I'm Spiraling and i do not know how to stop. (I Need suggestions, or general advice)",112mz6q,throwingcare,1676427421.0,4,0.84,"So as the title says I have been spiraling towards the bottom. I have a serious issue with sexuality, depression, relationships, and some talk about suicidal thoughts. so if any of that might trigger or bothers anyone please do not read  further I do not want to cause anyone heartache. 

I am a 30 year old man who never has been in a relationship and have never had a healthy relationship with sex. This spiraling started about a month before I turned 30, I was freaking out about how its a pretty big timepoint in peoples lives, there is no doubt you are fully an adult at that time. I was a virgin. I made the mistake of losing my virginity to an escort( I do not have any problem against the sex industry, the workers, nor those who frequent sew workers) but I very much regret losing my virginity and in general having sex with someone in that context. I've never been in a relationship nor has anyone ever seemed interested in having a relationship with me. This has been my own fault, I have been a coward and afraid of I don't even know what, rejection, embarrassment, truthfully I don't even know the root of the problem.  I decided never to see an escort again and try to work on myself, this resulted in me trying new activities, going to the gym, and trying and starting to change my appearance, joining a dating site and in general trying to stop making excuses on why not to do something. This resulted in some very positive things happening in my life but also I became really upset that still I do not know how to approach people to build relationships( I'm not just talking about romantic relationships but friendships as well).  I have always dealt with major depression in my life, with suicide  attempts and all of the worst stuff that comes with this bastard of a mental disorder. but since I've started to trying to change and fight my depression it has been worst then ever. I feel so depressed that thinking about taking my life feels pointless because I know I wont do it I know its just a depressive thought.  And I feel lonelier then ever once I started trying to build relationships again. This loneliness has leads me to see more escorts and I don't even know why. its almost like its not a conscious decision. I know all my life decisions have lead to this and I know its all my own fault that I find myself like this. I'm unsure what's even making me make this post I suppose a cry for help but either way I'm just going to stop here cause at this point I'm just rambling with no real direction. if you have read this far thank you for  taking the time.

I can’t see myself the way others do,112tiay,wankka,1676450944.0,1,1.0,"My entire life I have been constantly told the same narrative, that I’m “gifted”. It started from a young age, I started taking classes 2 years ahead when I was in 4th grade. If I ever got less then an A in a class then I “wasn’t applying myself”. Ive been expected to exceed expectations in every task that I’ve faced. Always expected to be at the top, no matter the scenario. No, I’m not trying to gloat. I’m 17, and this narrative has completely warped my personal image. I hate it. It’s to the point where every time I try something new and I’m not instantly good at it, I move on. Every time I don’t exceed expectations I hate myself. I have accomplishments that I’m proud of and I come home to tell my parents, and they simply tell me that they expected it from me. Yet somehow I can’t escape my own internal feeling of mediocrity. I want so badly to be impress everyone else that I cut corners to so. I use shortcuts, cheat, try to manipulate my way into being the best. All that it’s left me with is intense internal hatred and feeling like a fraud. I’ve played club soccer my entire life, and it’s ending this week. I was never able to reach the top of the pyramid, ECNL. I was always a team short. Soccer has been the only thing that I’m consistently passionate about. I love it. And yet despite my years of hard work, I never reached the top level. My last practice was yesterday, and I feel completely lost.

It's so easy to be happy now"" it was the summer after graduating highschool after a HORRIBLE drug and drama and misery filled senior year. I'd been a lifeguard every summer since I was 16. That year something happened and I was the most bubbly, outgoing, happy person. People liked me a lot. I made friends so easy it was crazy. I loved working there so much I picked up extra shifts. Teenage summers are so easy to miss. Then covid hit and the pool didn't reopen the next year and I was never a lifeguard again. I miss it. It's stupid but I've hated every job since. I've done everything and it's still miserable. I can't make friends with coworkers they really just don't like me no matter where I go. I hate being there.

I'm struggling with my job (it's not even perm), I'm struggling to learn to drive and I've been trying for 8 years, and everything is so bleak. I just don't see the point in trying anymore. I know I have a lot of good things but I'm struggling to find purpose or find something to keep me going.

How do I tell my over religious parents I'm depressed?,112m0ju,Schmoore,1676424496.0,2,1.0," It's been a weight on my shoulders for years. To some good extent, it's mostly because of my overly religious and protective parents. I was initially prepared to just carry this weight and suffer in silence until I moved out on my own, but I haven't been able to move out.
 Here's the twist. I'm not a teenager. I turn 26 in a few weeks. I'm an absolute failure as a human being. I've been working since I was 16 and have no substantial experience that would ""look good"" to any potential employer. 
 Last year, while I was working in fast food, I got my CDL. I got an over the road gig right out of school, and things were looking good. But me who I am could not handle it. Every day was a nightmare that wrecked me mentally to the point where it also hurt me physically. So I had to quit only 9 months into it. Came home to a bunch of frowny faces who don't understand why I just let a perfectly good opportunity go to waste. 
 After a 2 month grueling job search, I got another cdl job that was pretty much bottom of the barrel garbage. Even though I didn't like it very much, it was enough to pay the bills. (I pay for my own insurance, food, etc.), but not even a month into this new job I was let go. For the pitiful reason of ""I wasn't a good fit.""
 So now in present day I have enough money to survive February. But my depression and anxiety have been at an all time high. I can't sleep. If I don't have some kind of distraction in front of me I'll be unable to stop myself from crying as reality comes crashing down on me. There is no job I can legitimately find happiness in. Not one that I have any experience in that might actually get me shot. I have shit social skills, I have no talents or gifts, and everyone that's close to me won't take me seriously.
 I can tell them. But they will just give me some stock answer like how I need to go back to church or something. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I can fill out job applications all day, but I'll never hear back from 95% of them. And the few I will hear back from are some shady ass companies that see their workers as nothing but a cheap minimum wage labor slavery workforce. At this point... I might be suicidal. 

 TLDR: I'm incredibly depressed and out of options. And I don't know how to ask for help and be taken seriously.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/112m0ju/how_do_i_tell_my_over_religious_parents_im/

Now all I feel is this terrible sadness. I'm finding it impossible to get out of bed in the mornings because of this huge knot in my chest, a feeling of dread that another day is here. I can't go on like this. I only feel motivated during the evenings and I try my best to continue my studies.

Wish I had someone who genuinely loved and cared for me because I have no friends, the man I loved went silent on me and that has affected me the worst.

I went through ECT treatments and came out worse.,112i2zz,Boge42,1676413738.0,3,1.0,"Last April I finally got the guts to go through ECT treatments.  This is years in the making.  I haven't been able to because of my fears (I don't use the A word anymore).  I stayed at my sister's house and she drove me three times a week.  I didn't notice anything the first two weeks.  They switched to bitemporal and that next week I was out of it, confused, not myself.  Of course, I don't remember, but that's what I was told.

On my ninth treatment, I woke up sick that morning, was late for my treatment.  My sister came and got me and said we can still make it.  I was nauseas and confused. I guess my sister told the doctor I'm not right and shouldn't go through with the treatment.  The doctor wanted me to, but my sister insisted I shouldn't.  I went to the ER.  All I remember in the ER...it was like I was between life and death, behind a veil, a blurred window.  Everything around me was dark except that blurred window.  I felt closed off from the world.  I couldn't hear anything or see much.  I was presented with two choices.  Death, or let my sister speak for me to be treated as I couldn't talk to anyone.  I was lost.  I wanted to die so badly.  I used to tell myself, ""If death ever comes knocking, I'm going to answer and tell the rest of you See you later!""  And here I was presented with the option.  But all I could think was how devastated the people that care about me would be if I suddenly died so unexpectedly.  No way could I be so selfish and force that upon them.  So I kept screaming out to the people treating me, I was aware I was in a facility being treated.  ""Trust my sister!""  I kept screaming it out hoping they'd listen to her so she could advise them about my condition.

I came out of it and I'm back to my normal crappy self, but I feel scarred like I've been traumatized by that.  I have flashbacks every now and then that send me into an emotional attack.  I feel worse now than before I did the ECT.  I'm much more fearful about my death.  The inevitability of death for myself and moreso those around me.  I don't know how to pull myself out of it.  I was presented with the option to die and I didn't.  I'd rather suffer this life than force others to go through that pain.  You'd think I'd find some sort of peace with that, but I don't.  I keep wishing I would have chosen death instead.  But what if I chose it and didn't die?

There are no more treatment options.  I've exhausted them all.  I don't know what else to do.

How I get out of my depressive slumps,112jvm1,Hopeful-Pumpkin-9663,1676418446.0,2,1.0,"I've been struggling with seasonal depression for around two years now...it gets especially bad during winters (sometimes starting in autumn) and I live in the UK, so you can imagine the vast amounts of sunlight we get there :) 

It took me a while to admit that it was a form of depression. As a Psychology student I constantly preached the importance of mental health and how depression isn't just sadness, but when it came to my own mental health, admitting it was a problem was surprisingly hard. I think it might have stemmed from the fact that I secretly believed I was ""mentally stronger"" (not a real concept) due to a parental issues..

I think the depression could be triggered by my mom's first manic episode, which was a highly traumatizing event for me. But when that horrible, empty feeling stuck with me for weeks after and a majority of conversations with my friends asking why I was sad ended with ""I don't know"" on my part I realized it might be a non-event related issue...which really is what I find the most horrifying about depression. There is no external force that's making me feel like absolute shit. Yet I just feel like complete, utter shit. Like one of those walnuts in Plants vs. Zombies... 

Anyways, I slumped around and skipped class for a while before my boyfriend told me to try working out. It was during Covid so one day I decided fuck it and I rolled out my yoga mat and looked up a workout video. It was difficult to say the least, but it was also the first time I felt the beauty of endorphins and dopamine post-workout. My workout phase continued for the next couple of months of my life, and I'm extremely thankful for my boyfriend because of this. I regularly exercised prior to the slump, but finding something that I actually enjoyed was so crucial. 

I remember my lowest point after waking up at 4PM one day (I slept at 9PM the day before). I finished dinner and slumped around until 12 AM when I decided it would be a good idea to lay on the floor of my living room. I stared at the ceiling and for the first time in my life, I considered suicide. I knew it would never be actualized because I didn't have the guts to go through with that much pain, but it was the first time that that hopeless feeling truly got to me. I called my friend (who was much more depressed than I was) and I told her I think I'm depressed. She said it might be a short-term thing and I ended the conversation pretty quickly. The suicidal thoughts didn't persist, but that's primarily the reason why I'm hyper-aware of my symptoms. I never want to go back to that state again. 

The most important thing I learned about depression is it's not purely biological (because who would need therapy then) but this frustrating mix of environmental, psychological, AND biological factors. That's why exercising stopped being as effective for me because yes exercising produces lovely hormones and neurotransmitters that make us feel good, but if the psychological and environmental problems are not solved it will always be a short-term solution to a long-term problem. 

It could be because I study Psychology, but I'm always analyzing my behaviors for patterns that consistently show during each slump. I notice that it's usually accompanied by an increasingly messy room and around 5 more hours of sleep everyday.  I'm also much more irritable during these slumps, and I take it out primarily onto my boyfriend. It's never arguments, but short bursts of annoyance when he asks me for the nth time why I was feeling sad. Food is something I turn to as a comfort. I've always had a troubling relationship with food. During my teenage years I developed a bunch of food aversions and calorie counting habits, but during the slumps I literally *cling to* the thought of eating something sweet tomorrow to get through today. 

It became fairly easy to control the slumps once I recognized my patterns...but the most important part was realizing that there was no single action that could solve it immediately. I used to rely largely on exercising and it was helpful, but not enough. So, I made a series of..protocols that I follow everytime I notice the early signs: 

1. Exercise. I sometimes slack off, but when I'm feeling depressed I make sure to exercise Every. Day. It takes immense willpower and it sometimes takes 1-2 hours for me to even start moving, but I do it. 
2. Clean my room. I didn't realize the wonders that cleaning would do..it's almost as if I'm organizing my life together. Clean everything in sight. 
3. Listen to happy music. I curated a depression playlist that I listen to when I clean and it's usually full of songs that make me feel good. 
4. Not touching the bed before bedtime. This is probably the hardest to follow especially during winters when I want to just slide under the covers, but I actively forbid myself to touch the bed...
5. Going out everyday. Sunlight is already hard to come by, so I try to get as much of it as possible. And when I'm out..I make sure to smile while I walk. 
6. Write a to-do list. I usually write to-do lists, but whenever I enter my slumps I start procrastinating on work and slacking off in general. The to-do list forced me to kick-back and lets me realizing how much work I have to do. 
7. Forgive myself. I used to get anxious over ""failing"" a day, which means not exercising and not being productive, but the anxiety really only fueled the depression and it was a vicious cycle. So, I make sure to calm myself down when I've had a less-than ideal day. 
8. Waking up early. I find that the key to getting the sleep schedule back in place is to have an irregular work day. I read this in some self-help book (the title of which I don't remember anymore), but basically if you can't get your sleep schedule right, wake up at a ridiculous time like 4 or 5 AM..and start working then. That will kick your schedule back in place. Another thing that comes with waking up early is sleeping early (duhh), but it's so easy during depression phases to be up at 3 AM or asleep at 8 PM so I make sure to sleep at 12-1AM, which is my usual sleeping time. 
9. Smiling randomly. Everytime I feel bad I make sure to smile randomly. There's a psychological reason why that makes you feel better (but I don't remember now)..but it's a proven trick. The same goes with sweets..sweet things induce positive affect to make you feel better....

I hope I won't need to refer to this post extremely often, but I also hope this helps anyone who is currently struggling with some form of depression. It won't go away in one day and it may take weeks, but remember that moment you get out of bed and you smile and you feel happy for the first time in who knows when....that'll give you the motivation :)

My plan is to  wake up at 8 tomorrow and try to get my work done. I'll also exercise and have a cupcake :) maybe I won't finish all my work and maybe I won't wake up at 8 sharp...but that's ok!

\*do realize that if these slumps are not temporary but rather permanent/persistent, or you are experiencing constant suicidal thoughts, self-help might not be enough and start by talking to someone about it and then try to find professional help (I know help is not always the easiest to get)",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/112jvm1/how_i_get_out_of_my_depressive_slumps/
Idk if I have depression or mood swings or something more serious,112oa6e,RakeshSinghPoonam,1676431551.0,1,1.0,"Hey yall.

I've been feeling like absolute shit for a few days and me going to school during valentines day doesn't help a single bit. This sounds stupid but now seeing flowers and roses and people holding flowers and shit makes my mood even worse. On top of that I found out that one of my grades in my classes dropped so badly, and not only that I was miserable for a few days already. It got so bad to the point where I then started to think about killing myself or cutting and I went home on 3rd period. (not the first time i've had suicidal thoughts though) Litterally during that time period I was trying my hardest to hide my feelings as much as I can to some of my friends so I don't worry them, but then I couldn't do it no more when I hit 3rd period.

These ""depressive"" feelings even lasted for like a month almost around like 1 year ago

But the weird thing is is that some days I can feel happy, motivated, and excited and stuff like that, and even I couldn't figure out why I am excited. At some points I felt pretty hyper and I couldn't figure out why. That lasts for like a few days or weeks then I start to switch back to my current mood like what I am feeling right now.

I talked to a school psychologist about how I feel, and they said I might be showing signs of a depressive disorder, or whatever disorder of some sort.

I honestly don't even know whats wrong with me at this point, but for now, I'm trying many ways to cope with this till I get to see a therapist or psychologist tomorrow.

My 9 year old held me as I cried,112cari,Egg-Head-16,1676399025.0,5,1.0,"Yesterday, I had a terrible bout of depression come over me.
I woke up and wanted to stay in bed (which is how I felt prior to being diagnosed and taking medication years ago).. the entire day I was sad and felt hopeless. I was distraught. 

On the way to my son's (9 years old) baseball practice, I was trying to hold myself together and then I saw a pan pulling his little dog roughly and it made me cry.

I arrived at my son's practice and I was ""okay.""

Later, I tried to go workout but my son was with me so they didn't even let me in. 

We went back home, I raced to the bathroom and cried for a while.. I finally recollected myself enough to go upstairs with my son and continue filling out his Valentine's Day cards for his class.

He saw that my eyes were red and asked me if I was okay. I told him I was fine, but then started to bawl and have those weird hyperventilating breaths in-between. 

He asked if I needed a hug and I said yes, he came to me and hugged me. He moved items from my bed and told me to lay down with him. He held me for at least five minutes until I pulled myself together. He kissed my forehead and sat up and asked if it was something he did. 

I assured him that he did absolutely nothing wrong, that it was just a bad mental and emotional day for me. He replied with, ""okay mommy."" 

We went downstairs to get some food after and I was ""okay"" for the rest of the night. 

I just feel so terrible that my 9-year-old son had to take on that role of comforting me. While it was absolutely beautiful, it hurt me that he had to see me like that. 

This was the second time since I was diagnosed 3 years ago that I broke down like this. 

Have any parents had instances like this with their young children?

How did they and you handle it?

I understand that I'm still young (17 Male turning 18 next month) but I am already questioning if life is worth living. Last year I had finally come to the realization that I had depression and practically for most of my life too. There was this one time when standing on Table mountain for a school trip (I was 11 at the time) I had the first intrusive suicidal thought that I can remember. I had this strange almost piercing thought in my mind that gave me the urge to just jump off the edge (I have OCD and ADHD, which is why I have these thoughts I guess). At the time I was still a Christian so I prayed to not have such thoughts and passed it up as being the Devil's way of tempting me to sin (Oh how wrong was I). I have always felt lonely in some way and to some capacity, for years I was a quiet and weird kid with only a handful of friends but one day when I was 12 and in the 6th grade I had realized how much I hated being lonely so I tried being funny to make people like me and surprisingly it was to success. I had become somewhat popular but I never shook the loneliness I guess. I made people laugh so often that I forgot to be happy myself.

I like writing stories and drawing entire comics from scratch but recently I cannot catch a break to do what I love and enjoy, and then even when I do have the time to do so I have no motivation or energy. When I feel somewhat happy (at this point happiness, joy and just almost all emotions feels temporary almost like a short lived drug). Last year I asked my crush out and she didn't really say no but also didn't say yes (she said yes to being my valentine but more out of mindfulness). I understand her reasoning she experienced tragedy unlike anything I have and is a truly sweet, beautiful, innocent and loving person who is so understanding and strong despite having experienced so much (I feel like I have somewhat fallen in love with her but I am too young to know what love really is so I try to refrain from calling it such). I had learned of the fact my crush was trying to be mindful through people I thought were friends and I felt hurt because of the way they brought it about and treated me like shit after saying it to my face so plainly. This whole set of circumstances made me realize what was wrong with myself (that I had severe depression and for most of my life). I tried my damnedest to try and ""get over it"" only to learn of depression's permanence in many lives and even accepting that this may be me now (a depressed person hiding himself from the world through jokes). I feel so empty and emotionless like a machine, especially recently. About 2 weeks ago it was my matric induction on Friday and I felt physically ill during this time (I had dysentery with really bad stomach cramps). During the nights of that weekend I had huge bouts of major depression, feeling majorly suicidal and even started self-harm to see if it would help me to cope with life (I also started listening to Juice Wrld to better understand my feelings with Already Dead really hitting home). 

When I returned to school I felt so different, like I was dead or a machine. Seeing my friends' faces was so strange, even when I returned from vacation and holiday I didn't feel this weird upon returning but I did when I arrived at school after feeling sick. I feel as though I have changed in the span of more hours, it's so bizarre. Just the other day my friend (an actually good one) saw my cuts and he knew, so he reached out and truly helped somewhat. We have been communicating a lot recently about my depression and he has been a great help but you can tell he feels weird to have his one friend who always pretends to be happy in person experience strong suicidal thoughts and major depression. My crush also helped me so much, when she saw my depression getting the best of me (giving the best advice out of all my friends). I then told my one other friend about my depression but he was of little help. My parents (are great people and loving parents and there is not much better than them in this world) are heavily into Christianity, not to the point where they are completely unreasonable but to the point where they think God does every single thing and give only ""God"" credit for even their own accomplishments and saying that everything bad that goes on is of ""God's good will"" (I apologize sincerely if I have offended some but I had to show a representation). I have not told my parents that I am an atheist and they believe that I am a Christian. I also asked my parents what they think of depression and they practically disparaged it and all mental illnesses (something that is very dominant in my mother's family genes mind you). My parents told me that everyone has experienced depression in there lives (calling sadness depression, COMPARING A FUCKING MENTAL ILLNESS TO TEMPORARY FUCKING SADNESS!!!). My parents then asked if I was depressed and said that that would be ridiculous as people who are ""DEPRESSED"" commonly commit suicide and them proceeded to tell me not to think of doing it as suicide is a sin an will send you straight to hell because the shitty life that God gave you is great and must be preserved and enjoyed as God intended (I am rambling, I apologize once again for being so aggressive, the wording used is also not 100% accurate as you may be able to tell, I am greatly sorry for such aggression but I just have so much negative emotions bubbling to the surface as I write this).

After all this I don't know what to do, my depression is getting the better of me, my suicidal thoughts have become actual plans that I have completely thought out in my head and my self-harming has gotten worse with many more people noticing even my parents. My work rate and quality is declining (not that it has ever been optimal) and even one of my good friends nearly attempted suicide himself. I talked him out of it but the advice given by me was so pointless, null and void as I feel the same way as he does. All I could tell him was let's see where we can go in life, evaluate and live to see if it is worth living. Doing all this is stressing me out and is pushing me further to an attempt of my own.

Please all I ask for is some help and advice on my issues as I am so lost.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/112i0wf/i_dont_know_if_this_is_how_i_want_to_live_or_if_i/

So I usually come home late (bcs of school and my hobbys) and she comes screaming at me when I get home that I do nothing to help while shees doing everything. It wouldnt be that bad if that was the truth but shes the laziest person i know, she doesnt go to work, she always makes the mess and doesnt clean up after herself and when I try to tell her she just somehow turns it against me. She screams at me that iam useless and lazy asshole and I should get away from the house which ironically isnt hers. My dad is angry with her too but just because she is his daughter he just looks past everything. My mom isnt like that. My sister was emotionally blackmailing my mom and other really disgusting things. My mom doesnt really speak to her now.

So I get home today and my sister just does her usual shit. I try to ignore it but I had a bad day and I was tired but after some time I couldnt take it no more, I just got angry  an I told her that she is one of the causes of my bad mental health and that I more then once tought about suicide bcs of her and I was even close to it. She just responded with whatever. 

It made me more angry because for 2 months I was doing great. Everything was going good and I didnt think about my problems and it seemed I made the problems go away. But now Iam afraid the worst 2 years of my life are making a comeback.

It's only deep inside that you know that it's all a mask that you've put up. It's all a facade. And you are just sad. Lonely. Alone. Unhappy.

Sometimes, I feel like shouting and telling people how I feel. Sometimes I just feel like being quiet and being inside closed room.

I haven't drank alcohol or caffeine in 4 months.

After 2 years from that visit, i gathered up courage and asked for help, and went to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety, and wanted me to be kept under 24x7 supervision. I went to the psychiatrist all alone. They gave me medicines (clonazepam, escitalopram, propranolol) and told me to bring someone after 2 weeks.

My mom couldn't stand this that i was diagnosed and even prescribed medications. I was treated really rudely by her for a few days with the constant ""there is no need to consume medicines"".

Leaving that aside, the medicines made me fatigued and dizzy so much I couldn't keep myself awake. I got prescribed with zolpidem and higher doses of escitalopram and propranolol. This caused my BP to drop so low I couldn't keep myself conscious, my thyroid (TSH) increased 11 units above the upper limit and the depression still didn't go away.

If I feel the same, or even worse even after being in medications, is their really a way out of this? Because I cannot continue like this. And I won't continue if this is how it goes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/112i04u/is_there_no_solution_to_depression/

"Girlfriend of 10 years broke up with me, soon will lose my apartment. No energy to continue.",1127xwq,DaFreakzNL,1676388091.0,3,1.0,"Hi Reddit, I decided to make this post since I have no idea what to do anymore. Let me start by explaining how I got into this mess to begin with.

My girlfriend and I were together for ten years. Ups and downs are part of it, but we always managed to get through it. 2022 was especially tough, since her employer decided not to renew her contract, which caused her to be jobless in November (right before the most expensive month of the year), her car was found to be not safe for traffic participation (which means she had to buy a new one) and she bruised her ribs (during a game of rugby, this was especially hard on her since she got a lot of energy from playing). All these events caused her to become somewhat depressed and this did not improve the situation at home. However, we got through it, which made me realize we could overcome anything. Therefore, during Christmas, I asked her dad for her hand in marriage. However, a few days later, on January 1st, she told me she wanted to break up.

She was the one for me. I could not be mad at her, because she did not do anything to me which allowed me to hate her. We spend 10 years together, we been through so much together. Graduation, internships, living abroad, we shared everything with each other. Now she is gone, left me, all by myself. Our goals in life were travel, looking for a house to buy, marriage and maybe children. All those goals were terminated, I lost a huge part of myself.

It is incredibly difficult for me to be on my own, my best mates live miles away and I do not have a car. Family is barely willing to help out and two weeks ago my sister told me she did not want me to come to her birthday. No idea why. She only wanted to talk to me about it face-to-face, but only if dad was there as well. She knew that I was barely holding myself together, with the break-up and all, but she still decided that it was a good idea to put me through more emotional turmoil.

My ex moved out, she found an apartment incredibly quick, even though the housing-market is horrible and the estimated waiting list can be up to five years. She all about manifestation and that you can do anything if you put your mind to it. But I digress, she wanted me to put my name on the lease of the apartment where we lived together. This made sense and since I wanted to go through the entire process as adults (because I do not want to lose someone completely whom has been in my life for the past ten years and we still understand each other very well) I asked my landlord if it would be possible to change her name on the lease to my name.

He took this opportunity to raise the rent with $300 (this is allowed since technically I am a new renter and my name was not on the previous lease). This makes my total fixed costs come up to $1800 while I only earn $2100. With only $300 left over, this is not enough to live and buy groceries etc. This means I will become homeless in a month.

Everyone keeps telling me that I just have to get through this, but I see no point. My life has been reset. My ex took the friends, my landlord takes my home. I have no idea what goals I can set and every time I feel like I need to buckle down, there is always this inner-voice which convinces me that I am not worth it (this is also because I am still heartbroken and feel like I do not amount to anything). I have no energy to look for a new apartment, no energy to do anything.

I do not enjoy anything I do. I work out everyday because everyone keeps telling me that it will make me feel good about myself, but this is not the case. After running for 6 miles, I feel nothing, when I plan a 'fun' activity, I feel nothing, when I think about dying, I feel nothing.

It feels like I am already dead, at least, I feel like I imagine being dead feels like. Just an empty husk of flesh that wakes up in the morning, eats, goes to work, eat again and goes to sleep. No feelings at all. Some kind of cruel purgatory.

Even if I find a new apartment, I am still by myself, alone, with no goals. The apartment that I leased was very nice and now I have not only lost the love of my life, I lose the one thing that I felt like I could be proud of. I will end up in some kind of dump, by myself, as a 30 year old. Starting over again.

I do not feel like starting over. I do not want to date again, I do not want to go through the entire proces of getting to know someone.

I think about suicide every morning when I wake up, every night when I go to sleep. I do not know how I can start enjoy life again and I am sick of people saying it will get better, because that is not guarantee. I have no balls to end my own life. Like I said, I feel like there is no difference in dying and living for me at the moment and even if I tried, I cannot even do that.

Suffering,1125n2g,PermissionProof4677,1676382083.0,4,0.84,"Hello everyone, 

I apologise if this sounds a bit morbid and dark. But recently my depression / anxiety has shifted to a darker place.  I now have depression/anxiety for things I never use to have. 
All that’s been on my mind recently is all of suffering that takes place in the world, all you hear about is people getting killed for no reason, natural disasters killing people, just constant negative stuff going on around the world.  

I’m 21, young.  Barely lived my life. I’m terrified to leave my house because I’m worried I’m going to get attacked and that’s it, my life is over.  I’m also worried the people I love are gonna have bad things happened to them.  I cannot seem to focus on the positives.  The sun is shining, I’m listening to music.  Usually I’d feel great with the sun out and some tunes. But I can’t get rid of that thought in my head that, nothing is actually good because there is too much suffering. 

Does anyone have any advice for this?

Please, no one tell me “that’s just life” because that’s what makes it worse for me.

In June, the light sensitiveness in front of my eyes went away, and turned into pain behind the eyes when getting looking at unnatural light, like fluorescent light, especially from screens and bulbs. 

I also lost my sense of smell and my right ear started to make a crackling sounds which are quite loud sometimes. Also, I started getting tinnitus. All of these symptoms seem to be connected, when the pain behind the eyes is worse, and i look at screens, the crackling also tends to get worse.

On 11 July I decided to spend a whole day on my laptop, which resulted in a two week long migraine like headache where looking at screens was impossible. Since July 12 I've been unable to use screens as normal and had this constant pain behind my eyes which eventually can turn into a full blown migraine or headache, or just a horrible pain behind my eyes.

My eyes don't seem to be irritated by the light, but the place behind my eyes, can't tolerate it. The light goes straight behind my eyes and causes pain.

My amazing blog post,1122yqr,a_clueless_user,1676373445.0,5,1.0,"Hello depressed people. Here's a TL;DR for the following post in case you don't want to read a few paragraphs of me whining: man has everything society expects - feels awful.

With that out of the way I want to outline my situation a bit. I'm a guy over thirty. At some point when I  was a teenager I fell into depression. This was pretty bad and at some point during my time in university I seriously considered ending it all. Back then I was pretty lonely, internet addicted, closer to dropping out than graduating my bachelor's, isolated, and socially awkward to a degree that still makes me cringe today. Back then I decided to say ""fuck it"" and work on myself in order to improve my situation.

Here's the good news: it worked, I graduated and went on to do a master's degree in a field I love(d). I started working out a lot, worked hard and met a lovely woman who has made me happy for more then ten years by now. We have a beautiful child and I managed to work myself into an income that is very good for the area I live in.

If this were a movie, this would be the place where you go: happy shot of family in sunset, laughing wife, laughing child, laughing guy, roll credits, done. Unfortunately this is not how it's going for me right now. My depression is coming back big time. Achieving things like promotions, etc. really has lost most of its appeal for me. Somehow I'm feeling increasingly hollow. I guess this is what the DSM-5 would call anhedonia, right? I feel like my relationships with my family are at this point getting affected by my rising inability to really enjoy anything anymore.

Observing myself, I think I'm noticing something disturbing: I'm starting to sabotage things that would make me happy: I used to like to work out, but now I'm finding weird excuses to not do it - it's too late already, gym so full at this time, etc. and by the time I decide to go the thing will close in 30mins. I also like long distance running but I find myself procrastinating about going since my energy is so low. I guess the reason I'm doing this is that I don't want to feel the disappointment I get when I do something and it just feels shallow and tepid.

To be honest I'm at a loss in this situation. What do I do now? The most worrying bit is that this little nagging part of my mind that suggests ending it all is starting to rear its voice again, which is absolutely *not* something that I want to consider further.

One thing that I would like to ask though is: is this how all older people feel? Do most people's parents feel off to them when they are young adults because the reality of lifelong misery hasn't set in for them yet?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1122yqr/my_amazing_blog_post/

Am I overreacting?,112ehyh,s4gnomsust,1676404548.0,1,1.0,"
I’ve been going to therapy for a few months now, though I used to go to a children’s psychiatric clinic on and off for a few years. I’ve been getting tested for different stuff for a few months now, but haven’t been diagnosed with anything yet; but was told I scored high on PDD and generalized anxiety disorder. Honestly I don’t care about receiving a diagnosis, just the right care since I’ve been depressed for as long as I can remember.

Yesterday I saw a psychiatrist for the first time to talk about medication, and I brought up possibly starting anti depressants because I thought maybe that + therapy would help me because feeling depressed for so long has really wore me down. I know anti depressants don’t work for everyone and it can have negative affects, but I really wanted to give it a go.

The first thing he asked was if I ever felt happy and I responded honestly and said “no and I don’t really get excited or look forward to anything, I’m depressed for the majority of the day every day” and he proceeds to ask me what my sexuality is. I’m just going to try to write the convo down because that’s seems the easiest.

Him: do you ever feel happy?

Me: not really, I’m in a depressed mood for the majority of the day. 

Him: what’s your sexuality?

Me: what?

Him: are you a woman that likes men?

Me: I’m a woman and I don’t really care about gender, doesn’t matter much to me

Him: yes it does matter to you. So you feel attraction?

Me: yeah, I can appreciate people

Him: ok so you do feel happiness

He then switched the topic, I was really confused and maybe I’m just kinda slow and there actually was sexuality actually had something related to my depression but I just thought it was really uncomfortable? I also feel like he didn’t take me seriously overall, he suggested that exercise and good nutrition would solve my depression and of course I agree that nutrition and exercise has a huge impact on your mental health and self image; but I am active every day and take relatively good care of myself, I’m not overweight by any means, but of course I could always be healthier, most people could.

I let him know that I agreed that this is a huge factor, but that my emotions didn’t come from not exercising enough or not eating well enough and in response he chuckled and told me he could tell I was getting upset. I really was trying to stay calm too, I did sigh though and I think that was what gave it away. 

I’m not sure if he has looked at the tests I’ve taken or my patient journal because he never brought that up, but by the end of the session he said I probably have C-PTSD and again I’ve only seen this guy once. He ended up giving me sleeping meds and told me I wasn’t depressed enough for anti depressants. I’m okay with not getting meds but it felt really invalidating to be told that.

I can't take this hell anymore..,112e2mq,LostSouluk2021,1676403470.0,1,1.0," I lost the will to live a long time ago, everyday I'm so emotional. . Everyday I'm in a toxic house full of weed and a person that has always been very intimidating. I don't fit in with anyone at work, or at home, and just lost a girlfriend after a month. I go to work each day to put on a brave face in the face of adversity of not fitting in and being ignored. Meanwhile normal functioning people are gleefully discussing their plans with each other and their happy lives with a nice family and friends and a significant other. 

This life is hell for us sufferers, I'm tired of being around blissfully ignorant people who don't give a fuck. This is why there's such a stigma because we're constantly expected to put on a front when instead there should be more understanding and compassion. Doctor rang yesterday only to tell me to stay on these pills for another 4 weeks, pills that are making me much worse mentally and physically.

I feel incomplete and broken,11268lw,KyleMussettoCaino,1676383732.0,2,1.0,"A few weeks ago, my (25) girlfriend (28) decided to pause our 4 year relationship. We had great plans together: we wanted to live together but decided to wait until one of us had a somewhat stable job and she had more chances to be stabilised. One day her boss promised her stabilisation, but after some months this stabilisation did not come. He kept promising but said it would take some more time. She then snapped and suddenly a person always organised and prone to think of the future decided her future was not going to exist without that job, including me. So she spiraled down in a vicious circle of ""If I doubt of our future then I don't love him, but if I don't love him why is it so painful to leave him? Then I love him, but if I love him why do I have these doubts?"". I tried to talk to her and make her think but she said that she would remain into this circle and that sooner or later she would magically find her answers. She asked me to continue to go out together but without romance, so she would not think of the future. I also tried to suggest we should go seeking professional help together, but she said no because she wants to do it without any help, not a psychologist's, not mine, not her parents'. 

I am really exhausted. Also my job is not going well and my father is probably going to lose his. My dog is dying and my parents' house is crumbling.
I'm seeking professional help but I'm still really depressed. She is throwing away 4 years of our life for bullshit, for a problem that is not a problem and that does not concern the couple itself. If we can't move together now that does not mean it must be over. And then I think it's normal that love does not remain the same throughout the years: 4 years ago it was something new, then it evolved in something less explosive but more mature and prone to plan the future. 

4 years ago I was pretty resigned that I would always be alone and that I would die alone, then this girl approached me and suddenly the world was telling me that even I could be happy. Apparently this is not the case. I am not able to begin again, I don't feel like I'm a complete person, I'm broken, I can't move on.

Every night I even pray God, in which I don't believe, to kill me. I want to kill myself but I fear pain. I feel like I'm already dead but my body keeps on living and I have to keep going to work and doing the other things a living being must do.

I'm exhausted.

I want to take my own life but I'm thinking about my family,1120uk2,Low-Operation3286,1676369099.0,3,0.81,"I've been so depressed for a long time but I never thought of taking my own life. Until something broke inside me this month and I considered to do suicide. I've been stressing out for several months because of school works. I want to drop out because of a lack of self-esteem, being an outcast, and multiple insults that my professors threw at me. I have had a lot of bad experiences with teachers. Ever since kindergarten! But the things that happened to me recently just affected me badly. I have 3 professors this year in college that insulted me right in front of my classmates. The first one called me out for doing the wrong explanation for a presentation (I have social anxiety and I was nervous at that time). The second professor called me out again for saying wrong answers in an activity. The last professor got angry at me because I made a mistake in one of the parts of the group research. She insulted me by saying ""who made this?"", ""How did you even graduate senior high school?"", ""it's just a simple task and you can't even get it right!"". I mean, I know that I made a mistake but I think it's just so wrong to call out loudly the name of the student and even throw insults. I cried in the bathroom after she said that. Throughout my whole life, people around me considered me dumb and worthless. Now, I'm having difficulty studying and continuing my research because I'm scared of making a mistake. I'm also scared that my group mates would kick me out of the group. Aside from this, I'm also worrying about my future. I don't have a dream job but I want to give my family a better life. I'm thinking of taking my own life by jumping into a building. I want instant death. But I have doubts. My father is already in his 50s and as a firstborn, I was expected to be the next breadwinner of the family. Even if I want to drop out of school, I can't because I need to graduate to find a job and help him. Mental healthcare and Funeral are also expensive here. If I take my life now or in the following days and they find my body just bury me raw or burn me. I don't even know what to do anymore. I'm always asking God why I was born like this. Dumb and poor.I never consulted a psychiatrist yet but I think I've been depressed since 14 yrs old. All of the negative emotions inside me are building up and I can't take it anymore. Talking to my friends and family is not working.

Honestly, I was constantly searching for the nearest highest building in my area. If I'm not successful I'm just gonna throw myself into a highway and hope I get run over by a car. 

Sorry for the grammar, English is not my first language but I just want to vent out. I don't have anyone to listen to me.

"Some middle school student tangent, Please read",1124rn6,Ah-phie,1676379464.0,2,1.0,"I think I might be severely depressed. I think all this started like a year after COVID started. At first I didn't really bear it some attention, I thought it was pretty normal since most people tend to get sad when they lack companionship. Then months after It got worse,  But I was still to stubborn and believe it was just a phase teenagers go thru so I continued. I didn't really have friends or ever tried to make one since middle school. Im that type of person who will never talk to anybody unless approach to. The only thing I really give any fkcs about was my academics. So i think in the eyes of my peers I was this overly formal person who does pretty ok in school. One thing about having school during lockdown for two years is that you wouldn't really get the feeling of loneliness, I get to hide it by doing random stuff I like,  but of course that wont last for long. I was actually pretty excited when school is finally back, I innocently thought it was the end of this miserable lifestyle, I even thought of switching sections to be with an old friend I had before COVID. Going back to school showed me how much reserved and quiet I become. It was already the end of middle school so most people already had their groups, even that one old friend. Everybody I knew from losers and the popular kids before covid became matured and just cool as people. Everybody had their Groups, Everybody seems to be happy, except me. I am not really an open guy so I never tried to be friends or even approach them. The school had this weird rule where nobody from grades 10 and below weren't allowed to bring phones so I just sat their, glued to my sit looking at the window like some weirdo. But for a few times I broke that rule and did bring my phone and some old ass earphones, so I could listen to some music during recess. All this time alone made me so miserable so sometimes I Lie to myself. Saying that ""I'll just wait for next year, and for sure thats when things will change for the better"" or that ""I am that type of people who doesn't really need companionship"". The one friend I had in that class and only the one talk to, we have this weird relationship. The guy is also introverted as I am but to a lesser degree, so most conversations we have doesn't really work? It feels like as if were trying to be friends with each other but the only one who really drives our friendship is him and he already has other people who he is friends with so I think overtime he will probably  get tired and leave me alone. 

I really dont feel anything anymore. I dunno If Im even sad anymore. Everything just feels like a blur sometimes. I think I hold this deep seeded antipathy  at myself. I hate how I act sometimes, I hate how stoic I become, I hate how I cant be open with anybody, I hate that I put this facade of myself, I hate how obsessed I am with my studies, I hate how I cant be like everybody else. I really really wanna have friends,  I wanna talk about stuff I like, To make silly quips and banter, To do dumb shit once in a while. I am so tired but I just cant do anything about it. Like I feel like I am shackled about what other people already think about me, that I am this ""Nerdy kid who doesn't talk for shit"". I conformed to what people already think about me. My life is not progressing, I dont feel like I have matured whatsoever. I am self-aware but Im too much of a coward to do anything about it. My eyes are getting heavier every minute. I am afraid overtime Ill grow numb to it and desire no longer to do anything about it. Everyday I envisioned myself living for the rest of my life completely alone. Stuck in some apartment mindlessly working. No joy or light whatsoever. I know I am too young to think about such depressing things like this and just let life happen but I just cant help it. I cant help myself anymore. I wish some miracle to happen. Some flcl haruko type of character bust down that room and free me from this miserable life Im living, but I know that will never happen, This is something I alone should overcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1124rn6/some_middle_school_student_tangent_please_read/
Thinking I have something other then depression,111x8zv,Good-Professional-86,1676361476.0,6,1.0,"TW: self harm 


Sometimes I get afraid I secretly want something other than depression/anxiety because I feel so unresolved knowing I have those things. Considering the amount of time I’ve been mentally struggling, I’m fairly new to therapy and I tried ssris and didn’t have success so I’m not medicated. I have yet to have a long term therapist due to scheduling issues but I say this to say I know I should talk to a professional about this but I take some time to build rapport with and it’s just been weighing on my mind now. Also I wanna acknowledge I know you can have symptoms of something without having said thing. 

Recently I’ve been thinking I have BPD but there major aspects I think I’m missing. My main issues are I’ve been cutting myself since I was 11 (haven’t in about 3 or 4 months although I can’t say I don’t get tempted), I dissociate/depersonalize, i have 0 emotional regulation skills, I’ve had some food/body issues but nothing extreme I don’t think, and I can get extremely angry/engage in black and white thinking but I’m not very outward about it. 

Now I wouldn’t say I’m the perfect friend or I’ve never made a mistake, but I value my friendships a lot and I’ve been able to maintain many. I rarely if ever get in arguments about non-silly stuff. I’ve never been in a romantic or sexual relationship btw. I also don’t feel I’m impulsive (to a dangerous degree) and generally I’m pretty self aware. 

I cry all the time now, I used to never cry and be pretty closed off always extroverted but not very vulnerable at least to a deep degree. I was always open just never gave details. 

I’m sure quarantine era affected me but it’s hard to pinpoint how because I was mentally ill before and after. 

I just feel like I’m getting worse and I know I’m taking the steps (seeking professional help) but I feel like I don’t even know where to begin and like I’m not even expressing what I need to express in therapy. 

My relationship with self harm is long and complex. It used to work very effectively. Everytime I had an intense emotion I couldn’t handle I would cut myself. Sometimes I would go two months inbetween episodes. It was never weekly. Now/in the past two years I would cut myself but it wouldn’t calm me down the way it used to although it still feels good and I would need to do it multiple days in a row. Idk why I shared that but I guess for context. 

Anyways idk if it’s cause I hate college (which I almost failed out of) but I feel like I’ve gotten so much worse and it’s debilitating. I think I’ve always felt disconnected from people around me even my closest friends but I feel it so much now or I’m just drained from feeling that. 

Mainly I’m ashamed of how angry I get. Im not outward about it although with my parents I can be but I try really hard to be nice. I used to be such a positive go with the flow person. Granted I had no standards for myself so I don’t miss who I was but I miss parts of it. I feel like I go into another space when I’m angry like I don’t feel real. I’m able to recognize when I’m being irrational (sort of but if I can’t I choose to think I am so I don’t do something wrong). My feelings are just so intense and it’s exhausting. 

I guess I say all of this to ask, is it worth bringing this up to my new therapist or will I look like I’m just looking for a new label and does it sound like lm doing that? I mean am I ignoring the nuances of  depression and anxiety by thinking it’s something else?

Also so separate but I know ADHD (which I do have) effects emotional dysregulation so it could just be that but yeah idk.

Do I Have Depression?,1129rhv,hellonikhil,1676392667.0,1,1.0,"The main problem that I struggle with is feeling wrong. Not ""bad"" but wrong. My being, doesn't feel right. Whatever I do, the way I behave, the way I respond to things, the way I socialize, the way I speak, the way I perceive the world feels 'not correct'. That triggers a lot of emotional imbalance. It feels worthless to not understand basic things such as closeness with friends, families, etc. This, as a result insuinates sort-of-suicidal thoughts (?). In the Darwinain sense of the way, I mean. I am not fit enough to understand the society, so living is not something I am good at and hence I must... you know. Don't get me wrong though, I am not trying to justify anything here. It's just a thought which pops up in my head. Moreover, I am NOT considering that as an option; I have to live, at least for my parents, to have their back in old-age. But that theory remains in my head. And I really don't want to pass-by-life-at-least-for-the-sake-of-my-parents. But I can't think of anything else. And this dreaded thoughts has made be do stuff which could be considered serious (but I hope I didn't do it for attention, that's another dreadful tangent thought, to be saved for another post). On some days, however, I feel hopeful (and today is one of those days) but even that is shadowed by a fear that this motivated energy is just a guest of my concious for some hours and then  I am back to being wrong. 

All this, is it depression? Like a legit Clinical Depression? 

I don't want to sound like an attention whore ""Hey look at me, feel sad for me, I am depressed"" but I really want an answer to this messed up thing. Am I depressed? Or is it all just in my head?

I used to write about them all the time and tell them to my friends. They dropped in quality last year lol. There’s no beauty in them. It was like an escape from everything.

I feel nothing. I can’t cry anymore. There are times where I want to cry, but I just can’t. I cry when there are funeral scenes in movies and when watching really sad videos on YouTube. I may act all cheerful and upbeat and “innocent” at school and when I’m around my friends, but I feel nothing. Just nothing. I can’t get mad, I can’t get happy, I’m just a robot. I feel empty.

I’m new to this community so a little about me. I’m 23 F going to a community college. I’m taking environmental courses and have always been enthusiastic about the outdoors. (Camping, rock climbing, backpacking etc) in fact it’s the only place since I was little I’ve felt at peace, at home, or been able to feel like myself. I STRUGGLE with ADHD (which is a whole other issue). And As a teen I struggled with depression big time. And then it went away through a lot of help. And now it’s back but for different reasons. 

Going through these environmental classes it has me thinking non stop about ethics, about biology, I’m questioning everything. And now I’m starting to hate everything. I hate this phone. I hate this desk. I hate this house. I hate this town. I hate these movies and I hate these games. All the pressure. How fucked up and weird shit is right now in the world. It all feels so meaningless and hollow. I mean it’s like crisis after crisis. I know the media over exaggerates and under exaggerates everything. I am aware of this. But I can’t help but feel like everything is wrong. Like it wasn’t supposed to be this way. That were lost. That I’m lost. And I wish I had more power to change things. I know there are everyday small things I can do but... I just can’t do it anymore. Any of it. I’m burnt out all the time. Even after a vacation. I want to run away, but I don’t want to be alone. 

I keep thinking back to when when I got to go backpacking. I had almost nothing and I had never been happier. How can I go on pretending that I’m happy and content with this life when I know I’m not. And that there’s nothing I can really do about it. Im pretty family oriented and the thought of going somewhere away from them makes me sad. and I can’t just get up and force my boyfriend, whom I’m deeply in love with, into a life style he wouldn’t want. But I want to be free. Im so so tired….I don’t know what to do, or who to even talk to. And it’s hard to find people who relate. I feel like I’ve been pretending my whole life….A life I think I used to love sometimes.

Should I go to University?,1127jq4,decisionsdepression,1676387092.0,1,1.0,"I’m a 21 year old male and I’ve been deciding for awhile whether I should go to University or not. I currently work part time in retail at a supermarket 3 days a week, and I acknowledge that if I don’t go to Uni my only choice would be to get full time hours in retail.

I have a place for Uni for this year, September 2023 to study Games Design. However, it’s a hard decision. I don’t know whether it’s worth it or not. The reason for this is because I’ve lost lots of interest in games and computers over the recent years. I used to enjoy going on the computer a lot and had a lot of interest in how games were made, etc.

Another thing is, I currently live in a small town in the UK and there’s nothing much to do here. I live in an isolated area, I don’t have many friends anymore and I basically don’t have a social life. If I go to Uni I will be moving out of my parents house and out of this town into student accommodation in a city. I will be living on campus which is a 15 minute bus journey away from the centre of the city which has things such as nightclubs, bars, events, a beach nearby, social groups, etc.

Part of me is telling me to go because getting a degree would give me many more job opportunities with high salaries. A degree in Games Design not only would give me opportunities to work in game studios but will also open up many other opportunities mainly in the IT sector. If I got a degree I would be more successful as opposed to just working in supermarkets for the rest of my life with a low salary but many hours. There will also be many social opportunities and the fact that I may make some friends and will be able to go to a few parties and live life more in a better area is another huge bonus.

However, considering I said I no longer really enjoy games or computers that much anymore studying a degree kind of requires you to be somewhat interested in the subject you’re studying, especially something which is really technical and creative such as Games Design. 

This is a really hard decision but I really want to make a decision soon because I need to know whether I’m going or not to prepare for it such as applying for my student loan, accommodation, etc.

What do you guys think? Should I go to University? Why or why not?

TLDR: 21 year old guy, deciding whether to go to Uni or not but it’s a hard decision. Part of me feels like going for the freedom, independence, and to be more successful with better jobs. I don’t mind retail, but I feel I could do better. However, I’ve lost interest in games and computers over recent years, so not sure if it’s worth it.

I was in a marriage with I woman I was ultimately never in love with. 5 years, with her for 12. We had some good times but I was never in love. Just....content. 
I was too weak to ever tell her I wasn't in love. She had issues with cutting herself and thoughts of suicide, that was one part of it, maybe the other part was that I knew she loved me and that was nice to have. 
But I spent that marriage caring more about oartying with friends and doing my own shit, never giving a fuck about how she felt. She would fight with me about it and id end up turning it back around on her. I guess I developed a lot of manipulative tactics along the way. 

She cheated a couple times, I cheated a lot. But the last time she cheated on me I started to really reevaluate wtf I was doing and understood. I need to get out of this marriage. Not only because I wasn't happy. But it was selfish to keep this woman in a marriage I wasn't fully committed to. 

But in that time, in the beginning of the divorce, I started talking to a girl I had flings with on and off. I knew her my whole life. It was just supposed to be that. A fling. But I ended up falling hard for her. Really hard. 

She told me she was crazy, tried to tell me to run but ultimately I wouldn't. I was too far gone already. 

As we started to take things more seriously my ex wife was still trying to fight to keep the marriage. 

I came in one time on bedsheets covered in blood with her arms and legs all cut up. One time I came in and saved her after she had overdosed on pills. All the while the woman I was talking to was steadily pushing me to get her out and distance myself as much as possible. 

Idk. There's a lot. Alot a lot. I don't know how I'm ever going to get over all of this. 

Me and the woman have broken apart now for a week because of how horribly toxic we got toward each other but I still love her so much. I wish I hadn't have done the things I did in the beginning to her. I wish I hadn't done what I did to my ex wife. I should've waited until after the marriage was over. I fucked up so bad.

"Pointless, painful, pathetic",111vuha,hangdog4,1676356033.0,3,1.0,"I don't really know why I'm posting this.

&#x200B;

It's hard, every day, just living with the pain, constantly beating myself up.

&#x200B;

You suck, you're worthless, you're an idiot, a loser, a piece of shit. You'll never amount to anything, you've never done anything worthwhile, and you never will. Nobody likes you, nobody will like you, there's clearly something wrong with you. Just eat shit, give up, die.

&#x200B;

Why do I do that, beat myself up like that? I just hate myself. I don't see me as someone worth helping or saving. I'm too far gone. Weak, pathetic, a bundle of bitterness and excuses. A loser.

&#x200B;

I've felt this way fairly consistently since I was 13 or 14. I'm in my mid-30s now. I kept a professional life going for a while and had some success (not that it helped at all with how I felt inside), but always knew it'd eventually implode (which it has now). Never was in a romantic relationship for longer than a few months. Could never really share I how felt about things. Who wants to be around someone who doesn't see the point to anything, who just does the bare minimum? Had friends over the years, but they all end up fading. Nobody's ever really been there for me, and I guess I've never really been there for anyone else.

&#x200B;

I'm mostly resigned to being alone and unhappy. It's been 20 years that way, no real sign of changing. I've had so many therapists, been on medication, changed jobs, changed cities. Nothing really seems to help for longer than a few months, usually less. I always end up back in the hole, usually for years at a time. My time is mostly spent on lazy bare-minimum effort at work, binging tv, scrolling on my phone. I take care of the basics, going through life a miserable zombie.

&#x200B;

Like many of you, I think the main reason I stick around is because I don't want to inflict the pain and shame of suicide on my mother and brother. And maybe I'm always holding out some delusional hope that maybe, just maybe, something will change. I can remember feeling hopeful, excited, happy when I was a kid. I was interested in stuff, curious, I loved going to school and seeing my friends and teachers and learning things. Trouble started as we hit puberty and the social/romantic/sexual world became a thing. Turned out I wasn't so attractive in that new context. I was smart, but not so cool. Funny that something that seems so silly ends up having such an impact. I'm not sure I ever recovered. Never found my people. Never really felt socially comfortable. Always felt less-than, out-of-place, broken. People have told me that it's all just in my head, that I'm an attractive guy, that I'm interesting, funny, good-looking, caring, charismatic. Sometimes I can see it, I get a glimpse of it. But it never holds. I just don't see myself that way. Anything good just fades instantly, sand through open hands.

&#x200B;

Maybe sharing this is just a ""This dumbass was here,"" carve-your-name-in-a-tree impulse. Just scratching out a few missives before a totally meaningless existence fades into oblivion. Of course the missives fade nearly just as quickly. Maybe it's a cautionary tale for someone better suited to life (though most who are won't need it).

&#x200B;

It's so sad that things went this way. There might have been a version of myself who really could've had a fun, connected, contributing life. But whatever self that was died long ago. I'm not even sure what kind of trauma warped me so badly. My parents? School? Adolescent social life? All of the above? Whatever it was, I didn't have what it took to handle it, get through it. No resilience, no coping skills. Every little failure, every humiliation just beat me down and piled up to keep me down. I can (and regularly) do remember all of them, remind myself of just how stupid, how cowardly, how lame, how selfish I am.

&#x200B;

Does the world really care? Of course not. Everybody's busy with their own lives, and of all the people who are struggling with one thing or another, I'm nowhere close to the most deserving of anyone's attention. Sometimes I think there's something sinister about the way the world works, about humanity, about how we've decided to organize society nowadays, that it's fucked up, inhumane, that it shreds our souls and communities, destroys meaning, stokes competition and insecurity. But it seems to work pretty well for most people, most of them are happy, get along fine. So it's really just me wishing the world fit me a little better; who wouldn't wish for that?

&#x200B;

The solution seems so simple. Just try. Make an effort. No use in self-pity. Get up and do what you can. Be satisfied with what you have and what you get. You're here for a brief time and then you're gone and soon enough nobody will remember you or anybody you'll ever know. I won't do any of that. Not really even sure why.

&#x200B;

I suppose that's part of what seems so odd about our world - that so much of it doesn't make any sense given what seem to be pretty basic realities. Why are people competing so hard? Why are the stakes so high? We're all going to die, it all fades to dust. Why wouldn't we tune things to have pleasant lives, to be pleasant towards one another? Making things better is great. Having good ideas and creating new things that help people and expressing yourself through art or music or writing or whatever. Taking walks, climbing stuff, all of it. But it's also all pointless, which is totally fine. It's just an ongoing thing, a party, a state fair. People come, people go, eventually it'll all shut down. Can't we just chill out? Do all the cool stuff because it's enjoyable and interesting, not because it makes you better than anyone else or connects you to some divine immortality. There's nothing going on here, it's just a bunch of intelligent monkeys on a rock hurtling through an endless void. Why live in a way that inflicts unnecessary pain? But again, maybe that's just me; most people seem to get through just fine.

&#x200B;

Just try. Make an effort. But I won't. What's the point? I don't fit in this world. There's nowhere for me to go. There is no better for me here. It's going to be pain for a few more decades, and then my lights will go out, and that'll be that. Another monkey passing through.

I say over and over again, it's not that I can't feel joy, it's that those moments when I do don't make up for the slog. I'm constantly at a net negative of my own energy, I never can get back what I put in. And thanks to my severe ADHD, whatever I find some fleeting joy in is totally random, and sometimes overnight that changes. Good habits go out the window, it's like I can never really change and it fills me with guilt.

And when I vent about this and try to get some understanding from others, I get ""well that's life."" Like, that's just how it is.

Then I don't want to live it. If life is constant, unending mundanity with no end in sight with sprinkled in moments of happiness, I don't want it.

What's even the point of being happy? It's just my brain making chemicals that help me forget how bullshit it all is, making me productive. Productive to what end? What's the end goal? Doom some other human with my genes to the same pointlessness?

For so many years, the only thing that silenced the invasive, suicidal thoughts was the thought of what it would do to my family, the absolute soul-shattering grief they would feel, cause I'm lucky enough to know I'm loved. But now, I'm realizing their pain doesn't mean anything. If I died, they'd be suffering for no reason. There's nothing to be learned other than the fact that there is nothing to be learned. And yet, I still can't do it. I'm a slave to my mind. Just because that love and that pain is real, doesn't mean it has any meaning.

It's so hard to feel better when any time I try to make any kind of goal or get any kind of perspective, I'm back here, wondering why anyone does anything. I'm begging for someone to convince me otherwise, because as I see it, I'm a conscious mind that just wants stimulation forever and if I can't have it, why do anything, but I'm attached to a body that feels despair, and guilt, and love.

1. I was a much more outgoing person on the antidepressants. I wasn’t nervous to talk to people or so worried about them hating me. I understand this is a form of anxiety?

2. For the life of me I can’t get any kind of work started?! School work, personal work, errands/tasks like appointments, etc. I have so much to do but I end up doing inconsequential chores around the house, eating, napping, or sitting on my phone for hours before I even try to start some homework. I’ve tried letting my phone battery die so I can’t get distracted by it, I’ve cleaned my workspace to have no distractions, tried changing my scenery (desk, kitchen table, library, cafe, even sitting in the fucking car with my textbook). Even when I do start some form of work, my mind wanders and I find myself having to re-read things.

I’m so discouraged. Two or three years ago I would’ve had thoughts of killing myself because of this, but I don’t anymore so I don’t think this is a relapse in depression… I just don’t know if this is something worth speaking to my doctor about, or if I’m just undisciplined as shit.

But for whatever reason, anytime I muster up the energy to ask what I want... nothing comes to mind. I used to want my math degree and to work at an aerospace company, but I immediately think ""ok spend thousands more on college and spend countless hours suffering through more math that you will never need again, apply to tons of jobs just to MAYBE get one and have to work a 9-5 doing mildly interesting things every day.

My definition of depression?,111wu6o,realstor,1676359794.0,0,0.33,"Depression is nothing but our focus on a particular tiny problem of our life.
This is the nature of mind. For example, if you get wounded a little bit, your entire focus will be on that part for the whole day.
Likewise, if we don't have anything we want or a problem comes in our life, we forget what we have and get depressed.
For example, If we are depressed for more money than we have, we should think that there are a lot of people in the world who don't have a home and can't get one single meal properly.

If we are depressed because somebody left us, we should think atleast we have parent, brother, friends or family, a lot of people don't have someone.

"Physical depression after feeling ""better""",111wmrz,Ciderxi,1676358976.0,1,1.0,"Hi everyone, has anyone experienced the physical symptoms of depression even after they feel better? Heaviness on chest and emotional numbness/anhedonia,crying spells, laughing spells, all that good stuff.


Some backstory:  I've been depressed more on than off since the beginning of 2022. I had my worst depressive episode in December that lasted til early January. Nonstop crying, anhedonia, and my depression was so bad that every breath i took needed to be forced. It was exhausting just to breathe. Since my depression was due to external factors that I couldn't change or avoid, I decided to just take some anxiety meds again til I could figure out how to deal with my circumstances. 

In mid January I had to interact with the person who caused my depression due to co-parenting. The gist is that this person had left me to raise our kid alone for a couple years. This majorly fucked me up, and tho they've apologized, it could never make up for the damage they've caused. Anyways, when I interacted with them, I felt none of that. I felt overjoyed with the situation, and with him as a co-parent. Things were practically perfect, until I went numb maybe 2 days into seeing him. At first it was the heavy feeling in my chest, then I went numb or could only feel that painful feeling. I thought it was maybe due to skipping my Adderall, so I took it. It helped me feel at first, but I ended up having crying spells again once I felt everything I was feeling. 

I was overjoyed because I had everything I wanted for years, and upset because I was feeling so ungrateful (numb) and couldn't appreciate it as I should've. 

Ironically, my libido was the only thing that stayed regardless of how I felt. 

Objectively, I knew how I felt but I didn't FEEL it, if that makes sense. 

My theory now in hindsight is maybe my body was physically reacting to the cause of my depression and trauma. Even though consciously I was happy to see him, and happy co-parenting with him. I think my body may have sensed danger that wasn't there due to my past depression. Has anyone experienced anything similar? I really don't want to get on antidepressants again. Withdrawaling from effexor once I figure things out  sounds worse than whatever I'm going through. I'd rather avoid the brain zaps if I can.

I want to give up.,111wd9s,TheDoerTheDoner,1676357995.0,1,1.0," 

Alt-account for obvious reasons. I'm 15M. When I was 8, my mom had died, and because of this, we ended up losing our house. Me, my dad, and my two sisters living with us we're thus homeless. Me and my dad went to live with my uncle for a while, while my sisters moved in with older siblings. This happened in a matter of weeks, and this transition had just about ruined me.

When me and my dad had found an apartment to live in, I realized how lonely I was. Socially, even though there was some bad blood between family, all of them still loved me, and they mad sure to show it. Even so, I still felt so alone. The closest thing I had to a therapist was a school counselor in 3rd grade I'd meet every Thursday.

Don't get me wrong however, even through all of this, my dad was still trying his hardest to provide for me. Even through everything, socially, emotionally, economically, etc, my dad still tried his hardest to be a good father, and is still doing so.

I learned to bottle up my feelings, since with no proper outlet, the closest thing to therapy I had was music. It'd help drown everything out, helping me confront my emotions, while softening them down enough for me to not emotionally break down.

Earlier this January, I was at an emotional low. Bad thoughts, wanting to self-harm, a lot of bad things. It only lasted for a while though. It made me truly realize something though. I don't think I'm ready to be better. Even though I hated the feeling of hatred towards myself, I still want it. For most of my life, all I can remember is trying to just get to the end of the week, just trying to get by. If I actually get better though, then what else is there about me. All of these traumatic events in my life have defined who I am today. It's hard to explain, but it's like, if I lose being sad all the time, then what else am I? What else can I be or do? I've always been like this, and losing this feeling would be too much for me to handle.

I think it's important to realize that as a person, and as a child, I've gone through a lot, and on one hand, I'm proud of myself for making it this far, for being able to drudge onward through seemingly impossible odds. On the other hand however, it's tiring, and some days I just want to tell the people I love a final goodbye, and just end it. It's like an endless mountain of obstacles has come across me. Even with this, I feel as if that if childhood is this hard, then why should I try to make it to adulthood?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/111wd9s/i_want_to_give_up/

I had some personal issues that caused me to perform bad in school which led to a lot of anger from my parents since I was always a decent student. That all caused me a lot of stress and my energy levels started dropping quite a bit and it all eventually led to depression. I seriously started questioning suicide and I eventually told my parents my situation and they got me therapy and the help I needed. Unfortunately it never did anything for me and I just started pretending that it was helping and hiding my depression just so I could stop getting therapy. I had the same struggles through high school with the addition of bullying and before you know it, I was in my last year of high school and realising that I hated the career that I was going for. I thought it was too late for a change so I powered through high school and went to the college that I also hated. It was around around this time that I knew I would commit suicide one day.

Good Evening Folks,

I am new here and I guess I need an outlet other than my therapist I see monthly.

I am a 45M, father of two boys and we have a baby girl on the way the first week of April.

The last 2 years have been extremely difficult for me as I lost my mother and went through 2 open heart surgeries. The first to repair an ascending aortic aneurysm and the second to repair what they didn’t do right before. The second surgery left me with nerve damage on the right side of my upper body which is currently being addressed by pain management.

My wife is having a very complicated pregnancy. The first two were a walk in the park. This one has seen her in the hospital twice with complications and the possibility of a premature birth is very likely.

Due to the nerve damage, I have to take my time with laborious activities. The main example is getting the now vacant larger bedroom together for our two boys. I put together their bunk beds three weeks ago and
Intended to paint this weekend. That was until I went in there this evening to grab something out of there. I walked in to find the ceiling collapsed. I was in disbelief to say the least. I hadn’t been in there since Thursday when
I got some trash out of there. 

It rained but there was no evidence of a leak. It looks as though the heavy winds we had over
the last few days and an open window cause the damage. The ceiling had four layers…plaster, drywall, square ceiling tiles attached with some sort of adhesive, then a drop ceiling. It’s looking like the draft got in and shook loose the already weakened plaster and drywall and the weight of all that saw to it that the ceiling collapsed.

We are paycheck to paycheck . I get paid
Monthly as I am on disability and my wife is every two weeks. We have no savings, so we have to wait for our tax return to do anything with the damage. That be at least till the end of the month.

I am so beaten down and I don’t know what to do. Credit is poor. Running out of things to sell.

Friend ghosted me after I unintentionally dumped her.,111v98q,anthonyx916,1676353932.0,0,0.5,"So I met this classmate early November 2022 and we exchanged numbers and started talking. I told her my dad passed away last summer and she offered to talk to me and guidance, since she used to be a behavioral therapist. I told her about a memorial for my dad that happened a few weeks later and my stolen dog the previous year. She was very supportive but I kept texting her for support and I can tell she was getting drained, so I stopped texting her. 

Fast forward to mid December I called her to apologize for putting a lot on her and she started sharing her traumas with me too. I can tell she was trying to get me to chill by advising me to stop drinking alcohol and doing some drugs. And to consider a therapist.

Fast forward a month later in January she asked what my schedule was and I replied. I told her thanks for checking up on me and a few days later I told her a traumatic event happened to me during Christmas. I also told her about some childhood traumas. This set her off and she told me I was trauma dumping her again. I had no idea what trauma dumping was until she told me that she had her trauma going on too and couldn't help me all the time and that she wasn't my therapist. I apologized and said it wasn't intentional and that I wasn't in the right state of mind because I've been fasting for days trying to lose weight. She was kind enough to tell me that I overstepped her boundaries but I had no idea WTH she meant. She recommended me some local therapists which I did go to the next day which I told her about she didn't reply. Few hours later I got her statement of boundaries mixed in with what I thought I said about my dad's religio. 

I texted last Friday and she didn't respond. I started to look up what trauma dumping was and I learned EVERYTHING I coulduve known to save my friendship with her. I'm devastated because I felt like I messed up and if only I knew wth boundaries and trauma dumping was, I would still have a friend. I felt like I triggered her too because she also has trauma. I never sincerely apologized to her but I'm planning to do so. Right now she's pretty much done with me and I don't know her well enough to know if she blocked my number yet or not. 

I'm depressed right now. I was just trying to make a new friend but I was exposing myself way too much on her.

Opening Up & Fiancé Not Taking It Well,111un1p,Character-Badger6055,1676351822.0,1,1.0,"TRIGGER WARNING: S*LF-H*RM & S*ICIDE!

So, I have no fkn clue where to start. I will say, my fiancé seems less than willing to look up information on self-harm. I'm currently 22, soon to be 23, and have been in a committed relationship with my fiancé for 2 years. He knew about my past with sef-harm, and I thought he understood it. It turns out he might not. Every time we have an argument, the urge to want to hurt myself will pop up. I'm sure everyone, at least most of the people here, can understand how hurting yourself becomes addictive. I used to live in an abusive environment with my parents. I was 16 and decided to start cutting myself. I don't know why, and I don't know how, but I did. I live with those consequences today. It went from me trying to show my parents how their abusive behaviour was hurting me to punishing myself to relieving myself of the pain. One day, it was still that, but it turned into an addiction. I would just sit there cutting my arm open in rows. I liked how it felt and how I was in control of it. It was always my go-to stress reliever when I was a teenager. When I was 18, my bf at the time took my blades away from me. So I did my best ever since then to cope without hurting myself. I'm obviously with a new man who has become my fiancé. He is a really great and amazing person. Sometimes, it's really hard, though. He was aware of my past with self-harm and was open-minded about it. Tonight, we had a pretty horrible argument. I opened up and told him I felt like hurting myself. And yes, I made it very clear I wasn't going to and how I knew it wasn't going to solve anything. His response ended up being: ""Why is your response to always wanting to cut yourself when we have arguments?"" I tried to explain to him the addiction side of self-harm, and he didn't understand it at all. So I told him what my therapist had told me to tell him to do his own research on it. His immediate response was: ""I don't know where people are thinking I'm getting all this free time from."" It hurt a lot. I understand he's a cook and has a job and everything. Amd his mom always asks him to do things for her on his days off. But doing a quick research on something that has negatively impacted your partner shouldn't feel like a chore. I had no idea how to articulate to him properly the addiction side of self-harm. So I thought I would give him a good alternative. I don't know what to do, and it feels like he's slowly not giving 2 shits about me. I really want to hurt myself and just keep doing it until I die. I'm going to be honest. He me feel like a burden on him. He always is either passive aggressive or indignant in our arguments. So I have no idea how to approach him on this.

I get a phone call while contemplating just slitting my wrists in the bathtub instead. It was a homeless guy I had met a few months ago outside of a gas station. He wanted to hang out. I secretly hoped he would kill me and save me the effort. Instead he cleaned my apartment for a subway sandwich and two beers. Said it was the first hot food he’d eaten in 18 months. Hung out for a few hours, listened to music and played red dead. Gave him my weed and a backpack. Cried together. Ate the subway sandwiches.

If she has something better to do, it’s not like anyone else will care.

Am I depressed/what should I do?,111py2x,vaijjj,1676337532.0,2,1.0,"I’m not sure how to write everything out because I’ve never really reached out ever, so I apologize if it all is too vulnerable or convoluted or just obscure IDK HOW TO POST ugh.

As of now, I’ve just been feeling not the best. It’s been a year since my mom has died due to cancer and I just can’t seem to get over it because of how she always cared for me.  My dad never really cares for me, but I understand that he really doesn’t know how to take care of my needs when I’ve never expressed them really to him at all. I know that when he was raised, his way of being a parent now would be considered loving, but there’s just a void in the amount of emotional support I receive from him. I know that his rooted Asian culture may make father-son relationships without much emotional recognition or support is something normal, but I really wish sometimes he treated me with more love shown through talking about feelings. Its like unintentional negligence kindaaa idk.

I also feel the same way with male-male relationships, where I find it weird to talk about feelings with them. I’m not saying that all male-male relationships are like this, but it’s how I feel due to how I find there’s more microaggresions imbued in speech with the males I interact with. I understand Its something that may seem funny or idk jokeish, but sometimes I don’t understand why people say the things they say. Sometimes it’s just really annoying and boring. IDK is it human to think this wayyyy because I always like to be uplifting and kind to others while understand their views and potential reasoning behind them. I just wish the people I interact with would be nicer.

Sometimes I can just forget about the absence, but it still doesn’t help the fact that I have little to no emotional support from friends and family. Mainly since I don’t know how to really express myself or talk to others while being true to myself (I’m not sure if my unsociability is because trust issues or social anxiety or just being stuck in my thoughts), like I can talk to others, but I’m just scared of saying what I really want to say since I’ve never said it before. IDK HOW TO SAY, but like I feel out of touch with some people I’m not close with (Im not close with any people too) and it’s hard to talk to them with true intentions, like I WISH I could maybe change, but it’s so hard considering how little many times I’ve been able to feel confident in being who I was and not caring about what other people think.

Its also just really hard to stay happy because my feelings and my lack of self confidence and self esteem affect all parts of my life and its self evident to see the connections. I’ve never felt like I have ever succeeded in anything in my life and I always feel like everything I do is failure, like how I feel like I’m not being as charismatic or reciprocating to people or just not feeling confident in my contribution in class discussions/class participation. I know I’m not supposed to compare myself to others and focus of myself, but I always do since people always love to show off their success and I know it’s not of ill-intent, but it’s hard when I resent myself and feel like I could never compare. I know what I’m capable of, but I just can’t seem to reach my standards because I feel like Im so used to failure and not doing well: I don’t believe in myself and I don’t know how I can fix that.

I’m really not sure what to do because I feel like everyday spent without trying the unknown, which would be talking about my feelings to others or simply just talking, is like eating away at my life as I fall into complete hopelessness and despair, kinda like meaninglessness. Everything feels just so dull.

Addressing the question:
I’m not sure if I’m depressed or just crazy or if I should seek help because I don’t want to be a nuisance or bothering to others by telling them my feelings or just make others peoples lives harder. Will people truly care about me if I open up to them? Even if they’re a therapist or counselor because after all, therapists are like paid to be your friend. Are my feelings valid enough to seek help or should I try to stay independent and fix my life myself.

Sometimes I just wish I never existed, but some days it’s the complete opposite. I JUST IDK FEEEL LIKE AN OBSERVER rather the a human. ugh idk, but I don’t have any su***dal thoughts either.

TL;DR: I feel human, but don’t at the same time, and I don’t know how to be myself and express my feelings. I feel like a failure because of that, how I’m avoiding my problems and comparing myself to others.

Help I'm so stuck,111uda9,Current_Basis_3005,1676350884.0,1,1.0,"So I've been dating this guy 21M for four years. We both attend the same university. To be honest I used to be happier before I dated him. He's very toxic and pessimistic. He even slapped me on the arm and snapped at me. He even acknowledged that he hit me at that moment. Then later dismissed it by changing up what really happened at that moment saying that he did it on accident saying it wasn't a hit. It was a soft slap... (The slap left a red mark)

He has history of getting it on with people. He does the thing and leave them. He's been liking the photos of the person he did it with which he's allowed to. I sometimes think that he might still be talking to him but that's besides the point. I mean in this case it doesn't matter to me anymore.

I share what I'm interested with him he dismisses it saying ""does it matter?""

He has a history of always saying that he hated people and he hates other couples

I want to press the block button and avoid him at school(even if he comes up to me) I want to be happy again and the only way to do that if I cut him out of my life. I've cut people out like no problem but with this person I'm not sure.

He's never there for me. When I cried in front of his face he just sighed and turned the other way. When I was fainted the other day he texted me later that he was annoyed I kept fainting when I couldn't help it. He got annoyed at me and told him I wasted his gas when he comes to pick me up(I don't ever ask for a ride he's always the one offering)

He puts time for his friends more than me. Felt like an object collecting dust in the shelf.. he didn't care about me like he always says he does ""oh don't think I don't care about you"" he says ""I love you""

He hugs me everytime before we depart and I feel ugly inside and squirmish . I want to get away from him ,my brain says. ""Get away from me and don't talk to me ever again!"" I want to tell him. He doesn't care about me. He acts just like my narcissistic father.

Fast forward to today. For the past few years, I have commonly reflected on how much I have changed and how I'm nowhere near who I said I'd always be. In some ways, I became the person I said I wouldn't. When I think about it, it really depresses me again thinking about how much I have lost myself and don't know who I am anymore. 

Recently, a friend made a comment that has me thinking about who I am again, and that has resurfaced some other comments that other friends have made or things they have done that make me think about myself and how crappy of a person I must be. I'm tired of always being depressed, I'm tired of being ashamed of myself, but I don't know how to change. I don't know how to overcome this.

Progress venting,111tr7t,anoncosobvious,1676348909.0,1,1.0,"Throwaway account

I suffer pretty severe depression mixed with a procrastinative and stubborn nature.

I wanted to share some progress with someone but am way to ashamed to tell anyone I actually know.

The crux of it is that I'm making progress on cleaning my room.
I think I'm in the 99th percentile of fucked up with keeping my room clean. It's been probably more than 3 years since I got in and properly cleaned it.

It's my second day of getting deep into it and I've tossed 3 wheelie bins worth of trash away. Throwing out old stuff that was just sitting there collecting dust and finding that I actually do have a floor.

I've been stuck in this rutt a long time and it's affected so many aspects of my life. All I do is go to work and watch movies and tv shows. I have few friends and have never had anyone over.
The last time I cleaned it was when I was sort of seeing someone but the majority of the ""cleaning"" I did was hide it all in the cupboard. For once I'm doing it for myself and have struggled making progress.

I don't feel good about what I'm doing, I don't feel like I'm getting the endorphins most people would get for having cleaned up but if I want to make any progress in my life I gotta start somewhere.

I probably still have another day or 2 left at the rate I'm going but I just need to keep making progress, even if it's small amounts.

The higher dosage of my SSRIs are already paying off,111olvy,nothing-useful1,1676333857.0,2,1.0,"...It's both a good and bad thing, I suppose.

Today my grandma fell around 3 AM. It woke me up. I watched how it happened through the cameras in her room (put there for her safety - she has dementia). My mom was already helping her up by the time I forced myself on my feet. For some reason I couldn't bring myself to leave my bed. I watched her struggle on the floor through the cameras and felt nothing. No panic. No pain. Has my love for her left?

My heart has become so cold. Is it the depression blocking the caring? Or is it the meds? Are the meds making me become a zombie? A mix of both?

Either way, I kinda like this state of uncaring.

At least for today, it's saving me from committing straight murder.

Later in the day, my grandmother completely forgot she fell. My mom had to remind her, because she had no idea why  the walker was right next to her bedside. It's usually leaned against a different wall in her room.

She instantly goes back to blaming my dad for eating her food (he isn't). So she tried to do her angry rant at me. I didn't listen to a single word.

'Kill her,' my mind whispered to me when she started ranting.

She's already dead. The husk shouting at me is a vessel that only resembles my grandma. The grandma I truly loved had died a long time ago, when the dementia killed her brain. I'd just be putting her vessel out of misery.

Luckily the urge was dull. It's not strong enough to act on. I'm isolating in my room again. Only this time, I'm not in full meltdown mode like before. I'm still able to be fake 'ok' around my family if they come try to talk to me.

Thank you, new meds.

I'm oddly calm through all of this thanks to them.

Now I'm just sleepy... Hopefully sleep will come quick. Gaming would usually comfort me but I don't think I can bring myself to touch a console today.

I self sabotage for no reason and I don’t know why,111siaw,ihatemrjohnston,1676344993.0,1,1.0,"I’m discovering new trauma responses developing in me. Including avoidance, emotional flashbacks, emotional dysregulation, easy startle response, fight or flight mode kicking in when trauma is triggered, feeling stuck and only wanting to think about the horrible things I experienced but there is a new one…self sabotaging. 

I self sabotaged yesterday. My mom had been constantly triggering my religious trauma. I was getting emotional flashbacks. I told her repeatedly that she is triggering me and she refused to step back and continued arguing with me. Something in me snapped and I physically attacked her by gripping onto her shoulders real tight with my nails. She pushed me off. We both fought each other. Left scratches and nail marks. It could have been a normal quiet weekend. But for some reason I enjoyed fighting her in that moment. I was even frustrated she didn’t hit back harder. I wanted her to hurt me more. I wanted her to give me a black eye or something. I was angrier she wasn’t fighting back as hard as I want her to. It broke my heart to see her cry afterwards. It broke my heart to hear her sob. 

I’ve had other occasions where I created problems for myself for no reason. I was in a mental hospital and I fought with their transportation service driver and ended up getting blacklisted (fuck you Avalon, no one needs your rides anyway) and had to call someone else to pick me up in the middle of a blizzard. I was red zoned in that mental hospital then and ripped up whatever worksheets they gave me on impulse control and fought with the staff and never came back. This was a clear example of me ruining things for myself.

I feel like life has no purpose you just do stuff until you die. I don’t feel like I’m going nowhere, I’m in college I bartend in NYC I’m a veteran, so I know I have a lot of factors to myself that are great and give me purpose, but I just think life is purposeless. Everyday I feel more and more unfulfilled, but the thing is I think fulfillment isn’t real. I’m able to enjoy tiny moments but I feel like whenever someone tells me about traveling (which I’d love to do) I just see it as any other hobby, and that it has no real importance. All the goals I have are unexciting, but the thing Is that I’ve changed hobbies and career paths about 5 times and still nothing seems to bring me slightly close to fulfillment. And the lifestyle I’m chasing seems superficial and almost horrible (business path) but anything less than that seems more unbearable (I grew up poor and don’t Wanna go back)  


I’ve also been dealing a lot with morbid thoughts about the universe and existentialism. I’m not sure if it relates to anything but I’ve had a nihilistic viewpoint. Usually I get seasonal depression but this doesn’t feel like regular depression, it feels like I’m dying, and all the world is losing color. Nothing is exciting, sometimes I even feel physically weird. Almost in a trance. I can’t even cry about my sadness, I don’t even think it’s sadness maybe realization and that’s scarier. I’m not going to do anything to harm myself, my best friend who I served with killed himselfand I’ve been upset about it however now that I’m a vet myself I understand why he did it, but the pain I felt from losing him made me want to never put that pain on someone else. Honestly the pain from losing him Is the only emotion I feel lately. I don’t feel much else. I’m confused and in need of guidance I guess.

Just venting about my depression and what to do.. with some gaming references,111mr6l,Anarox87,1676329063.0,2,1.0,"Okay so this is my first reddit post ever. Still figuring out how this thing works :\] . So I'm a 35y old male, and I have depression. I was diagnosed (kinda) by psychiatrist about 7 years ago. She said ""probably depression... or anxiety with secondary depressive symptoms"". My problem is, that I'm not \*actually\* depressed or sad or in grief. I kinda gave up on life, and I don't mean I'm suicidal. I'm absolutely not suicidal. Best way to describe it maybe to imagine an MMO game which you played for years (35y to be exact :\] ). You rolled a character with stats but They came out in an awfully bad combination. There are some high ones but they are useless without at least decent other stat in combination, lets say playing a barbarian with high str high charisma but shitty dexterity and constitution. With my personal example (I think) I have decent intelligence score but my skill to organize my work is absolute shit. So I have this character with its shitty stats, played with it, maxed out the skills as much I could but its... all? I log in this game of life each morning drag myself online/to the office and work.. I'm utter shit at my work and I know I could do somewhat better but why bother? It's not like I will get a promotion or a raise with my shitty self management and charisma and my absolute inability to organize my work. Woman in general dont like me. People in general don't notice me. I have shitty humor. The game is shit with this character. I would like to quit and reroll but I very well know there will not be a new character generation screen, I have to play this character for I don't know... 50 more years...? If I want to play. And it sucks to see everybody is useful or talented or interesting in some way but I'm not. Like I'm a prank, a parody or something like that. 

Nowadays it's getting worse. I was not like this 10 or 15 years ago. I was a loser alright back then too, but I was always like ""My time will come! My hard work, struggles and honorable behavior will pay off!"" Spoiler: It did not pay off. My friends got married, promoted. They are wonderful people. Interesting people with interesting hobbies, humor, work, life!. I made 3 diplomas in engineering and science (I live in Europe) because the only thing I'm good at is to understand things and learn things IF somebody organize them for me like a University does to some degree. But I'm on chimpanzee level in organizing and implementing things so I don't use those degrees one bit. Companies hire me because they think I'm good for something but it's a trap. I'm really good for nothing and my boss always ask me if I have a problem or feel good. Man, I don't feel good I can't handle my workload independently no matter how small and I'm overwhelmed. I think. But I really say I feel good and I just got a big load.

I'm also ugly. I mean I'm not horrendous but I have a stupid face. You know, the one people want to punch because it just calls for it. I have a stupid voice too. No wonder woman are not attracted to Me.

There was also no point writing this I guess because it's too long and uninteresting and did not help me one bit. But I had to do something because I have an awfully bad day and My friends are usually does not give a flying f about what I have to stay, nor my family. It will pass They say. It never does. I just pull my shoulders and log in the game next morning and wait life spitting in my face again during the day.

I felt guilty because I barely talk to my mum and I always resented her but at the same time she was emotionally and kind of physically abusive towards me and my sisters. Well, she was really abusive to my sisters in comparison to me, they are not her kids. We have different mothers so I guess she was and still is the evil stepmother to them. Despite everything I still love my mum so much and to think that she had to sell her body, she had to endure hurt and abuse over there pains me. She used to tell me that she lived in Italy and that it was really lovely. I thought my mum traveled across Europe to explore but not for her to become a prostitute.

i don't want to blame it all on my autism; i'm a bad person and i know i am, but i work really hard to be better and to be kind and caring to other people. no matter what i do it's worthless, though. it doesn't matter what i do or say or where i go or how much i practice my social skills in therapy, it's like i have a neon sign hanging over my head warning people not to get close. plenty of people like me on a casual level, but no one actually cares about me, no one asks me to hang out or what i'm up to or if i'm okay (and yes, i do these things for other people).

i feel like i've exhausted my options. i've seen multiple therapists over the years and no one seems willing or able to help me. i guess i can't expect them to fix the fact that i'm unlovable, but i just wish they'd stop trying to sell me their bullshit on top of it, you know? i've done everything everyone has asked me to do: i went to therapy, i started medication, i improved my social skills and reached out and did everything everyone suggested to make friends, and i'm still alone and unloved. i don't want to give up and i'm not suicidal but sometimes i really feel like dying because everything just seems so hopeless.

"To ""disappear"" somewhere else in the world or to keep moving?",111pi28,Firm_Bed_2554,1676336288.0,1,1.0,"Good evening everyone, I am posting this on a throwaway account, and although this may be a long post, let me know if I violate any rules (even if it is just some backstory). Anyways to whoever reads the whole thing, I thank you for your time!

So a bit about my predicament; 

I am a mid-20s guy currently diagnosed with ADHD, MDD, and anxiety. I have been on meds which have worked fine, but I am not suicidal. I do however tend to make risky choices with no regard to my well-being and have developed slight alcoholism (ie. drinking during the week when I don't have classes or other things to do.) I am physically fit and tend to run every day. My family life is decent, but my relationship back home is iffy, not that we get into fights but I am essentially on my own in the world and whatever choice I make is mine like I am not tied down by them. 

Now to the main issue: This is not some ""achievement"" or a ""bragging"" post, but I feel this information is necessary to get the full picture. I am currently a student at the best doctorate of pharmacy program in the nation. my time here has been extremely rough. Although I love the material I study, I never was the best student in my undergraduate studies and it shows here. there are around 25 other guys and in my program and 125 girls, so already I am fairly isolated. I used to talk to more people in my program, and hang out with guys, but because I am ""not the smartest"" or have ""fallen behind"" and have done so poorly on exams where others have succeeded (I am not at risk to fail out but most people are striving to make perfect scores...) I have been even further ignored, and isolate, I try to make plans and reach out to people but I am canceled on, and ignored, people, make plans without me, etc. all in the name of advancing their studies and trying to associate with people who will challenge them to perform better, and I am viewed as the wrong person for that. Aside from that, I have made stived to talk to people, to improve my grades, but every day less and fewer people reach out to me, despite me doing all the ""right things"", like taking initiative, getting a tutor, meeting people with similar interests outside my program. To sum it up, I am in a good school but I have been incredibly lonely even as an introvert, and despite doing all the things other people have said to do, and what a counselor has said to do, I keep finding myself being more and more isolated, almost like I am doing the wrong thing and the world is trying to tell me to shift paths.

With all things considered, I am very well-rounded. I have my bachelor's, I am very good at meeting new people, and I love to travel, hike, and camp, either alone or with a small group. I have self-taught myself Japanese since high school, and have taken classes and worked my way to being conversational. Now I have been at the end of my rope here in school (not with self-harm, but more simply wanting to pack up and disappear into a completely foreign land and explore) My question to the community is which of these three options is best: 1. Continue along my schooling and graduate in the next 3 years despite how miserable it gets, 2. Say screw it, drop out, and get a job in Japan (since I can speak the language, or another country such as Korea, Thailand, or Vietnam, for medical research which is my bachelor's degree), or somewhere in between, such as randomly booking a ticket to Japan on my own for a week when I can afford to miss class, travel on my own, and pray that I gain some ""revelation"" or a sign that I am doing something right or I should switch paths. Also, a note to add, yes I am aware of the culture shift. Learning the language has taught me about the culture and people of Japan. The culture shock is kind of something I am actually craving. Has anyone else felt like this? Is there any advice one could offer that may address something I am missing? Really anything is appreciated, I'm just so sick of being a shut-in and not having anyone to talk to lol

Friends and depression,111o5c5,Admirable_Main_3479,1676332656.0,1,1.0,"Throwaway account and sorry in advance for my mistakes, non English speaker here :).

Alright, so I'm depressed and even though it isn't my first depression, it is the hardest one I had so far. I've always battled with this since I was a teenager and managed to get out of those episodes. The last one lasted 4 years but I came out of it.

Recently, after two very hard years (grief, harassment and lastly a break up), I've finally hit rock bottom. Basically, I'm 33 and I had to go back to my folks after the BU, completely broke and with no job. I've tried to have a job, the last one lasts 3 days. I was constantly crying and I was unable to focus. Anyway, well you've got the picture. 

I have a therapist that I see twice a month and I've tried meds but it was impossible for me to cry because of them, so I've stopped. So I fight as I can. 

The thing is I feel so unsupported by my friends. And quite honestly, I'm deeply decepointed. I've always have troubles to ask for help but I try to do it differently now. 
So now, when I feel bad, I tell them. Not to much or into too many details because I know also that I can't drop too much on their shoulders and that they also have their own problems. They're not my shrink and have boundaries which I respect. And I said this because before in the past, I made this mistake and regretted it. 

 So all my friends know that I'm depressed and one of them know that I have suicidal thoughts. But no one seems to truly care or even care to listen to me. And I'm so sad, so hurt by this. I won't say I'm not the best of friend, but I've always listened to them when they were in trouble. They stay at my place, I comfort them and always wanted to know what their life was about. 

And so far, I had few calls, some of them say they're sorry for me. Or that they don't feel good to listen, which I respect, some of them just don't mention my depression. Or say they'll call and don't. And so on. And I try to be a good friend to them, despise the depression, and force myself to maintain contacts. 

And today was the worst for me. I had my friend on the phone, who truly know how hurted I'm, because I told him, and he spent two hours talking about his thesis. I'm not even exaggerating. I was trying not to cry during this call and he just stopped talking when I said I had to go eating. He said he was sorry for this long talk and that it wasn't balanced and we should call another time. Then sent me a text on WhatsApp with a work that he did for me to read. I just feel used, unconsidered, and I really wanted to have support because I've been crying all day for this all week, those all 6 months. I'm at rock bottom and feel alone. Well, I have my therapist and my mom is really amazing and listening to me. 


But it's just, I really thought my friends will be there for me. As I was for them in the past and as I'm still in the present. But I'm also thinking maybe depression is really a curse and friends can't handle it. And that you can't really count on them or partially. I dunno, I'm lost and decepointed. 

So I was wanted to have some perspective on it. Do you ever experienced this? How are your friends during your depression? Do you talk to them? What do you expect or not with them? Well, what do you think about this matter.

I am a 20-year-old commerce student based in Morocco, and I come to you today to share my personal story of battling depression. I am currently facing an unprecedented challenge in my life, with a financial crisis affecting my family, a recent break-up with my girlfriend, and difficulty connecting with people in my school.

These challenges have shaken my self-esteem and left an unfathomable void within me. I feel powerless in the face of these obstacles and am often caught in an inner struggle that leaves me feeling hopeless and incompetent. I am often overwhelmed by procrastination and too often tempted to lie to myself.

Depression has taken away all that brought me joy and fulfillment in life. I feel lonely and isolated, gradually losing my close friends. I feel disconnected from university, unable to identify with the superficial mindsets of my classmates. 

 I understand that many of you may have gone through similar experiences, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or support that you may have to offer. Are there any strategies that have helped you cope with financial difficulties or break-ups in the past? How have you maintained a positive outlook on life during tough times?

I am truly and wholy depressed with my life. I have nothing left to live for and to make it worse, it's all my fault. 

I was with my fiance 9 years. I was her first bf, she was my first gf. Lost virginity (sex and kiss) to each other. 

Yesterday was her birthday when everything came crumbling down.


Over the past year we've had issues when it comes to intimacy. I wanted sex more and she didn't and was just not interested for the most part. On top of that, she wanted kids and marriage and I just didn't. It caused many arguements and horrible times for both of us. 

November 2022 we almost broke up over the kid situation and ultimately wanting different things in our lives. It broke me and probably broke her too.

At the same time I started getting interest off some girl in my gym. I knew I shouldn't act on it, but I was weak and I did. It was just chatting at first for a few months. 

I liked the attention, that someone actually wanted me. Of course I knew my fiance wanted me but there wasn't a spark there, just felt like stagnation, she didn't lust me. 

So a month goes by and I decided I'm going to call a break on our relationship. To see whether this is what I wanted or whether I just needed a release or something I don't know.

I called a break with my fiance and it broke her. It killed me, but she told me to leave and to give her space and time. So the break started.

What kills me most is during this break she self reflected about her actions and how to improve. Whilst I just copped off with some girl to get it out my system. 

Few weeks go by and we get back together. However, I didn't end it with the girl. I still felt our relationship was going to end. I didn't want kids and she did, so I kept it going. I also didn't know how to end it with the girl. I didn't care for her at all, but she seemed to like me a lot and I didn't want to upset her. So I digged a hole and kept.my head in it, carrying on this false life. Living two relations. 

I was stressed, I felt sick, depressed, but I didn't do anything. Why didn't I do anything?
I just kept panicking about both and feeling like the shittiest person ever and hated my life but I couldn't stop.

Yesterday was her birthday. I was at the gym and she texts me. SHE KNEW. My heart stopped and I believe part of me died. The girl messaged her and told.her it all.

All my stuff has been dumped and I'm back at home. I have the most horrible messages from everyone on my phone and it's well deserved.


I don't regret having a break and copping off with some girl. I don't regret keeping it going. But I regret, and this is what will depress me for life. I regret the feelings I have caused and made to my ex-fiance. Those messages will haunt me for ever. The ripped up pics of us will haunt me forever. 

I am truly and wholy depressed. And I do not want to live any longer knowing I have ruined her life and caused her so much pain. I still love her. I would kill myself now for her.

I don't know what to do anymore. I've cried and bawled. I've hit myself black and blue. I don't want to live anymore. I don't want to feel this pain and this guilt. But I deserve it all for what I've done. I only wish I had the guts to end it all. 

I am miserable. I am depressed and I doubt that will ever change.

What's wrong with me?,1116peb,JaguarHistorical4765,1676290060.0,4,1.0,"A little bit about myself and my life To begin, I am 17 years old and have had a difficult childhood, which was followed by traumatic events such as verbal and physical abuse, as well as sexual molestation. In addition to that, my mom has been mentally ill for the past 9 years (possibly longer), and as a result, I've had a lot of big responsibilities as a child. I've been depressed and suicidal since I was a child, and lately I've been feeling even worse, to the point where it's interfering with my studies. I thought of telling my parents and getting therapy, but at the same time I don't want to. I'm scared of losing the feeling of being miserable, depressed, and suicidal. For some odd reason, I really like this feeling. I like putting myself in a position where I'd end up feeling really miserable, both mentally and physically (I don't self-harm using objects, but lately I've been considering it). Normally, I don't eat at all to the point where I start feeling extremely nauseous, or I eat very little, like a slice of bread, and then I'd go on with my day without eating anything else. Recently, I've been losing a lot of weight because I'm doing this every other day. Also, this might sound crazy, but I have burn marks on my arm. I burned my arm accidentally while cooking. I'd look at my arm, feeling really happy to see the scars and wishing there were more scars like these, and I would consider making more scars by burning myself or cutting myself. I haven't done it yet, but I've been feeling a strong urge to do it lately. I also hate it when people care for me and try to comfort me or make my mood better. They ask me what's wrong and if they can help in some way. This really irritates me, and I get extremely angry, like I don't want people to interfere with my life to try to make things better. I really like feeling miserable, but at the same time, I want to change. I don't know what's wrong with me.

A meme made me realize that nobody really cares about me,111h9st,QuirkyHistorian,1676315606.0,1,1.0,"Saw a meme this weekend on one of those FB pages that's clearly just a content/meme farm. It should've elicited a chuckle and all it did was make me MORE depressed. My closest friends keep proving me right that I'm not special to them at all. I'm expected to help plan elaborate birthday get togethers for people while I can't even get folks to show up for a single dinner for my own birthday. The person I THOUGHT was my best friend is taking one of our other friends on a trip (that is taking place around my birthday and that I wasn't invited to despite 3 of the 4 people being ""close"" friends of mine) because said friend has been working so hard at her job. Meanwhile, I spent a week in hospital a few weeks ago due to a serious suicide attempt and fucking crickets from this group. Needless to say, I have come to the conclusion that none of these people are truly my friends and that hurt to admit.

I am terrified of dying alone. I have my husband, parents, and a couple extended family I am close to, but at the end of the day, what does that matter? My parents are old and in poor health, the extended family have their own lives and are too busy for me, and my husband will likely die before me or leave me. I told him last night, that if he died first or got fed up with my depression and left, I would truly have nobody left in my life that actually cared. The only reason I'm still alive after my suicide attempt is because he realized something was wrong and called 911. If I lived alone, it would've been days before anyone even found my body. 

I'm not grateful I survived. I'm not happy to be alive. In fact, I WISH I had succeeded because I don't like having to come to terms with just how alone I am in this world. I don't like having to admit to myself that I'll never be happy. I especially don't like the knowledge that my husband is the ONLY thing I have in this world besides our cats. I have major depressive disorder that is ""treatment resistant"" as both my psychiatrist and previous therapists have confirmed. I can see the toll this has taken on him. My depression has spiraled to the point where I am incapable of caring for myself. He does everything around the house: cleaning, laundry, most of the cooking. The only time I cook is if it is something that can be microwaved despite having been the main ""chef"" of the house before my depression got bad again. I just don't have the motivation to do it. I am on a leave of absence from work and I spend my days in bed forcing myself to sleep. I literally spent all Friday in bed only coming out of our room to eat a little or use the bathroom then I would go back to bed. I know in my heart that eventually, this will get to him and he will leave. This is no longer a marriage or a partnership. I am this depressed woman he is legally bound to that he is the caretaker of. My psychiatrist says I fall for confirmation bias all too often, but is it really bias if all the bad things you feel about yourself are true? Saying my friends don't care about me isn't a self-fulfilling prophecy if it's reality. So is saying that my husband will eventually get tired of all this and leave is not negative depressive thoughts. It's a fact. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this all here. Probably because I get to anonymously vent and speak my mind? I guess I just want to be heard as I don't believe for one second that the people in my life will care to hear.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/111h9st/a_meme_made_me_realize_that_nobody_really_cares/

 I've been going through a lot over the past 10 years, and she was my support through it, I knew she had her own struggles but I guess I was a bit too blinded by my own problems to see that there was a bigger issue, and she didn't want to add to my stress by dropping it on me at the time. 
She had overcome her trauma and had come to a resolution, which is why she finally decided to tell me. But her resolution didn't seem like a resolution to me, so I was trying to get a better understanding of the situation, but it came across as me questioning her decisions and being unsupportive.

I've apologised and she's accepted my apologies but she said she no longer wants to be friends because she's turned a new corner in her life and needs to surround herself with positivity. 

I respect her decision but I feel a bit lost. She was the last person I had and I messed up.  I'm stuck with a load of destructive thoughts and I no longer have someone to talk me off the ledge.

I don’t even have the mental strength to fight against the thoughts anymore. I don’t know what to do. It feels like a vice or a nail that’s been drilled into my brain.

Sometimes writing saves me,111h3gs,sadgal22,1676315175.0,1,1.0,"Summer is fading away

Mornings are getting colder and days are shorter

This tiny familiar spot on earth, is getting ready for hibernation, once again. 

I feel it in my bones, and mostly in my heart. 

As I get closer to celebrating a quarter of a century in this body,

A sense of deep sadness and lost connection to myself is getting hard to ignore. 

I seek comfort, in a glass of wine, or in the arms of my patient lover. 

Daydreaming about a world where nobody would expect me to show up anywhere

Where I could hide and feel all of my pain. 

My heart in sinking, that I haven't found purpose or that I'm not being a helping member of my community. 

A community that doesn't speak my language, or that I still know nothing about after a full year of permanent residency.

I'm no longer angry, but hopeless. 

After loosing my spark,

And my excitement to learn about the world. 

I remember thinking this earth was a playground.

That I was meant to discover and to learn about, with so many places to see.

My existence has now come to survival.

Waking up to get to my messy desk, but empty office,

To spend my day ''helping'' the rich class spending on luxury furniture that they will even use

To exploit the last of all my skills, so that my boss can buy himself a fourth luxury car, 

Or to miss on exploring the world, just for my curiosity.

I'm sinking, 

To think about how many years it'll take me, 

Exhausting myself in a domain I once adored,

Just so I can finally have a piece of land somewhere to call mine

The irony. 

The american dream is dead,

And so is my inner flame. 

At 24 years old I realise, 

My dreams of having a functional family is unaffordable, 

My savings will not be used for pleasure,

My bachelor, my failed business and my professional ambitions led me here just a year later, 

Already dead inside, robbed of all creativity and hope.

After all, that was the plan all along. 

For this made up way of living that's keeping us from being in touch with our true nature. 

For always wanting more and treating ourselves with temporary pleasures

It’s not great but it’s honest work. 

I wish I weren’t such a coward
One day, 24 Hours 
Thats the time that would pass
The memories will fade
With the tightening of the lace
Along my neck, holding so tight
I am losing my will to fight, fight, fight
Death seems better 
Nothing can get you
I’m hanging so loosely on the end of my tether
I wish I did but was too scared to complete
And again, and again, I have to admit defeat 
I wish I could cut little lines in my arm
Oh, it felt so damn sweet to self harm
The emotional pain digs and digs
But the nice bloody cut so tiny like twigs
Wrap around my arm again and again
The emotional pain is squashed once the physical pain begins
I wish I could bleed, longer and longer
Until I could not stay awake any longer
My body goes still
My fingers grow cold
My mind goes dark 
And there’s no one to hold
Maybe God will reach for me, but maybe he wont 
But in the end, the story is still true 
I’m such a coward
it should’ve been 24 hours",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11179yg/im_such_a_coward/

"The last 6 years are a blur, I can't stop thinking about how much time I wasted by being like this",1111ayt,IlParnassoConfuso,1676269104.0,9,1.0,"After I graduated from college at 21 and it became clear my parents would not accept that I was trans, I just gave up. Up until then I had dreams of being acceptd by then, coming out in the safety of our house and then, maybe a year later, to come out of the proverbial coccoon as the woman I was supposed to be. 

I would continue my education abroad where I would have a chance to start from zero, where people would know me only as this new person I became. I would form a small, but tight knit group of friends, fall in love, get married, live my own life. But ever since I've had nothing to cling on to, instead I just spend hours in bed agonizing about the incertainty of my future until 4am when I finally manage to sleep. I wake up at noon and sit in front of a computer all day, dreaming about an alternate reality where I was born normal, beautifull inteligent, accomplished. Sometimes I daydream about being a normal person having my normal little life, sometimes I marry into royalty and live a life out of a fairy tale where I live in a palace and no one in my family will ever need to worry about money ever again.

I just can't believe its been 6 years of nothing. How? How am I 27? That's basically 30, 3 years is nothing if I didn't even felt the last 6 years. How is it possible I'm no longer one of the young ones? I'm no longer fresh out of college, with all the time in the world to figure things out. Now I'm almost 30 and I ran out of time.

The feelings of caring too much. Breaking too much. And then having to put the pieces of my heart back together. 

I am depressed. I close myself off from the world. Someone manages to sneak in. They make me feel incredible. Then they disappear. And I am now even more depressed, but with suicidal thoughts. Repeat.

I have spent my entire life alone and I get majorly attached when I’m shown any kind of love and attention by someone else. When they leave, my past of rejection, isolation, and how I always had to take care of and protect myself as a child is triggered. My trauma that I have never processed resurfaces.

Meds and COVID and Cleaning My Room,111eade,pawoods12,1676308188.0,1,1.0,"2023 has been pretty bleak so far. Yet, hope still lingers.

When my insurance changed on January 1st, one of my more crucial medications was no longer covered. Even after the pharmacist added a coupon, 30 pills cost $600.00. (Obviously I live in the United States.) It wasn't until after a week of withdrawal that I thought to look up if there was a savings program offered by the manufacturer. ALWAYS look at the manufacturer's website to see if they can make the medication you need affordable. I finally managed to sign up for the savings program, give the info to my pharmacy, and obtain the medication! Tonight, I take my first dose back towards sanity.

A week ago today, I got sick. Tested positive for COVID and have since run the gambit of symptoms. Weirdly enough, this past week has been one of my better weeks in the past year or so. My number one depression coping mechanism of late has been a nocturnal and excessive sleep schedule. Getting COVID meant that, not only was I expected to sleep all day, I was supposed to. This past week, I haven't had to put energy into my physical appearance or into pretending I'm doing okay. The ever-present sadness of deteriorating interpersonal relationships disappeared, replaced by fevers and coughing fits. No more guilt around feeling useless. COVID gave me purpose. Suddenly the steps I should take to improve my life were as simple as ""drink water."" I got over the worst of the sickness yesterday. To my dismay, the booming voice of depression began again in my head. The tumult of fear and grief came rushing back. Part of me longs for the all-consuming fevers and body aches to return. Much rather physical anguish than the cage of depression.

As much as it pains the depression in my head to hear, however, things are looking up. The loose trash on my floor has morphed into a collection of plump trash bags. I'm beginning to spend more daylight hours awake. I have full bottles of all my medications. I'm hydrated. Once my prescribed isolation is over, I might even... Cook? Vacuum? Go for a walk? I know the depression, which has followed me since I could first form memories, will always be there. Yet, just as I know the despair is inevitable, I can rely on the fact that there will be moments in between. Not necessarily joyful, or even happy, moments. But moments which make this life worth living.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/111eade/meds_and_covid_and_cleaning_my_room/

the thing is I don't receive any forms of pleasure from taking it, it simply makes me feel normal, which I have tried explaning to him. however, it only ever goes back to his smoker comparison. growing up, I have never actually been able to talk to him because he never listens and only invalidates or criticizes me.

I also have insomnia, and have difficulty sticking to a sleep schedule. so there are times where I have missed work because of it. so when it happens, he takes every chance possible and blames my inability to sleep on my medication, which ironically is supposed to help me sleep. It frustrates and angers me to hear something so ignorant, pinning an effect to a convenient cause that fits his narrative. 

so he always finds ways to make me feel shitty so I will stop taking my medication, claiming that antidepressants are bad for me when it is one of the major things keeping me sane in the unhealthy environment I live in. he thinks that doctors do not have my best interest at heart, and that I should listen to him instead of actual professionals who have years of experience in this field.

"I don't want to kill myself, but I don't know what else to do. Please help me.",1110nim,reversestructure,1676266804.0,4,0.84,"**First, here's my best summary of why I hurt and want death. The meat of this post and overall point however, is further below, starting at the header text.**

I first tried committing suicide in 2016. Then I had the best opening ever to kill myself in 2021, but didn't take it.

I regret both of these failures immensely, I'm beyond tired of being here and continuing to exist.

I'm endlessly frustrated by the brick wall waiting for me at every corner I turn, whether I'm actually trying or not trying at all. Because as much as I wish I could stop existing, I don't want to die.

Not many actually want death. Many who crave suicide do so more because they no longer want to experience the negatives of their circumstances, escapable or not.

Why have *I* craved suicide since I was 14? Aside from the world being hot garbage, and the species being hopeless and cruel, the primary motivator for my suicidal desires is actually pretty narcissistic.

I won't delve too deep into it, I can never usually explain everything in a way that captures the actual pain of it all. But putting it simply, my mood and spirit have deteriorated rapidly because of envy, because of skillessness, and because of incapability.

Wanting to draw, or make music, or make games, or at least make custom content for games. I've run into so many pitfalls trying to pursue these things, it's unreal, and a lot of it has to do with the way my mind is structured. One, because I can't handle failure, and two, I seem to have lost my sense of passion.

In January of 2022, I made a last-ditch effort to get myself into drawing, and it ultimately failed. Even though I went through a handful of drawing courses, and sketched a couple pages of figures, it was for nothing. I had to force myself to do it all, and I dreaded the idea of continuing. It felt like school. Painful, unfulfilling, pointless, hopeless.

And I'll try finding out what's wrong, and why I'm like this. And I'm usually met with the simple answers that apply more to healthy people.

*""It's just not for you.""*

*""Quit. If you don't have passion you're wasting your time. Plain and simple.""*

*""Drawing might not be your thing.""*

I'm poking at the hornets nest of people opposite of myself, people with passion, real artists, making an ass out of myself because I don't know what else to do. I don't know what's going on with me. Why, and how? How can I crave something, yet be so hopelessly unable to even strive for it?

I don't want to elaborate on why I want to draw, or create in general, but just know there is a lot in my head I wish I could put into the world in the ways I desire.

Because of my circumstances, I'm rather limited. It's mostly been coping by thinking out loud while pacing in an empty area. In the backyard at night, in the garage, or even just my room. I'll try reaching out for help or advice on Reddit, as though any professionals exist on this site. (Art professionals can't help me, I'm talking about medical professionals.)

My situation of complete inability to do what I wish I could, or work towards it, has all but crippled my spirit in general. I've drained to a point where nothing is interesting anymore.

Music is getting boring, repetitive. I'll witness art I would've liked, but I'll only long for the abilities it took to create it and lament the lack of my own. Interacting with other people is something I've come to despise, feeling valueless in the absence of any abilities, or anything remarkable or at least noteworthy about myself to bring to the table. The idea of continuing life, getting a more permanent job, trying to sustain myself and become independent, it just sounds awful. Boring, and requiring more effort than I could give without buckling.

***

# So, why don't I just go to therapy? Or see a doctor? Or talk to someone in general?

Well first off, I've definitely tried talking to people such as family and friends. I regret it. Someone being there doesn't help with these issues. I need the problems gone. Talking about this to anyone who gives half a shit about me only serves to waste their time and cause them pain. They don't know how to fix this any more than I do. Last year, I decided I'm never reaching out for help again, for the sake of them.

Second off, I'm 20 and I still live with my parents. It's pretty embarrassing, all my siblings were excitedly out by 18. I don't have a job so no income, I don't have transportation, obviously I have no skill so nothing I can do well to make money, and I don't have independence. On top of all of this, my parents aren't the type to be open minded to mental problems. After hearing the horror stories of how they treated my mentally ill sister, there's no way I'm opening up to them. Never. They aren't abusive, but I don't want to be here. I have no way of escaping that doesn't involve some great effort that'd probably push me over the edge into the pit of suicide anyways. All while being that age where if everything sucks, no one will take your issues seriously because you ""haven't lived life yet"". I'm not going to if I can't get out of this pit.

Third off, since I have no income, and since this is the United States, I can't get professional help. No therapy, no doctors, no medication. All I have in my pocket is $400. As much as I'd love to book it and attempt freeing myself, life isn't fiction. Having to face the world alone as a skilless shut-in 20 year old with virtually no knowledge of how to sustain myself in most areas, it just sounds like a different if not worse hell for me to hop into.

Three consecutive years, of strong non-stop suicidal ideation. And every time I try to dig at the roots, it's another nightmare.

I don't want to die never knowing how to create the things I wish to create. I don't want to kill myself and hurt my family. But I also don't want to live and rot into a pathetic disappointment and hurt them worse either.

I don't know what to do, and I'm starting to hurt myself on impulse. I think I gave myself a concussion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1110nim/i_dont_want_to_kill_myself_but_i_dont_know_what/

I dont know what to do with my life,1118do3,ApartmentLopsided453,1676295315.0,1,1.0,"Hello there 

I must start with a little context ig but I live with my partner and i moved with him a few Times ago now. I managed to make some Friends where I live and have multiple IVL Friends and acquintences. 
As long as I recall i've always feel very depressed : ive been severely bullied at elementary and middle school and had a very toxic kind of relationship in hs. I always loved anime, video games and art but some times in my life i went thought music phases and stuff. I managed to make friends and more with people but something seems Always wrong when I talk, express my interests and how i feel with people, even the few ones i trust.
Since 2020 i went back to what i loved at first which is anime and video games. And thats where it gets complicated.

I Always had a complicated relation with life itself. Never seem to find a goal to achieve here, any thing that would make me useful. The only thing I wanted was being loved since i had a lot of trouble with people before in my life. I chased people attention since I was able to finally make friends and my first relationships. I am severely suicidal since the age of 11 and it doesn't seem to go away with Time.
I went to therapy in 2021-22 but since I moved out theres no psychiatrist ready for appointements and the public system is full so im still on a waiting list. And i desperately need help.

My state of mind got way worse since November. No doctor to prescribe me my usual medecine (Paroxetine40mg), I cant stand my reflection in the mirror so Bad that i avoid them, i dont shower, dont move from my computer all day and the situation with my partner isnt at its best. I want to change and at least try to enjoy things in Real life but I cant do it anymore. I get really fond of the things I gain interest in to the point where I live only for this thing. Atm its Persona 5 Royal. I wake up to play it, eat, play again until i finally shut down the game to read more about it, draw the characters and i invent a character to put me into the universe. 
I want to cut ties with all the people i know to focus on my interest and the game universes i gain interest in over the past few years (especially p5r and DGR). Since I moved out from my parents I moved with my partner very shortly After (3 months) and my illnesses makes me feel like they're more a new father than a partner. But I am totally incapable to take care of myself normally, and i think they're getting sick of this as much as I am. I feel like im going to explode one day and just want to be alone completely. Ive been too greedy of human relations and now I have a life that on the outside can seem great but I just can't see the bright side. I want to isolate myself but I can't. I dont know what to do, I'm on the urge of finishing my life for months. I'm kinda Desperate.

My mom is forcing me and gaslighting me into going to my grandfather’s funeral,1117two,SouthAfrican_1,1676293700.0,1,1.0,"My mom (39 years old) is gaslighting me (19)and trying to force me into going to my grandfather’s funeral this coming weekend after I told her that I cannot mentally handle being in that sort of environment because I have been struggling with severe depression and anxiety for the past month. She doesn’t care to hear even though she understands this very well. My reason for not wanting to go is not that I do not want to support my cousin’s family, it is just that I have been in a really bad place mentally and funerals in my culture are very much the women’s responsibility. We have to cook for hundreds of guests, prepare snacks and emotions support for visitors like we’re not the immediate family of the deceased. On top of that, we have to clean the houses multiple times a day for those visitors to sleep in because most of them would be coming in from across the country. All this is very emotionally draining and stressful for me. 

When I told my mom that I don’t think I will be able to handle going to the funeral, she took what I said to be selfish like I don’t want to be there and to support my family but I really want to be there. She just doesn’t understand that I want to take care of my mental health because I know I’m on the edge of doing something stupid. 
The funeral preparations themselves take the women a full day and a sleepless night to just prepare food for the guests and I struggle with sleep so I didn’t mind that. Another thing I cannot mention to my mom is that I don’t want to be around my aunts because they make inappropriate and provocative comments about and to me TO MY FACE because they know I cannot react or show emotion to them cause I will be in trouble for that.

I wish I had incurable cancer instead.,110fgrg,Leather-Jicama7000,1676207670.0,81,0.92,"I have had this disdain for life for as long as I can remember. When I was a child, I had hoped I would die early. As a teen, I tried to pursue it. As I creep up to adulthood, I feel like everyone has invested so much in me (time, money, themselves, etc...) that if I were to successfully die of my own hands, I would be willingly fucking up their investment.   


Dying would not make them happy, but living is also not making me happy. It is making me feel guilt, immense guilt. So much guilt. So, as a compromise, I don't try to die at my own hands, but I am also not treating myself ""like I should"". To just let myself go enough wherein I don't have to think of myself, but also still have enough energy to do what I need to do, I feel is a good compromise. Yet, why is it that it makes others upset? Why must I enjoy living? Why can't you just let me be upset over being alive? Why do I have to swallow my guilt, shame, and misery but you get to take me hostage with your emotions about how my state makes you uncomfortable?  


I wish I had cancer instead, then everyone would let me be miserable. They would understand why I hated being alive. They would let me stop trying and allow me to succumb to cancer because they understand it is selfish of them to force me to go through medication to keep me alive for their sake. If I had cancer, everyone would let me be and they would be forced to take their discomfort because I am dying soon and it would be true.   


With relief so close to me, I would be able to enjoy life more. I would love to make sure their last memories of me are happy. I can't do that right now because pretending to be happy every day with no certainty as to when it ends is so exhausting.

I got accepted into university in august, a natural science base year and had to move 2/3h away from friends, family and the city i grew up in.

Even though I am bad at math I really really wanted this to work and i thought it would. I got my parents to spend money on education books and much more.

Frustration with procrastination,1115v36,pphead420chubgus,1676286951.0,1,1.0,"Hello, I just wanted to come on here to ask if anyone relates/has actual useful tactics to help deal with this. 

First of all, for context: I am turning 20 soon, I've been going to therapy for maybe a month and a half. I don't have any official diagnosis for anything because the place I go to is strictly talk therapy. So I apologize in advance if I can't give straight up info about what I'm suffering from. 

Onto the actual thing: 
I was assigned male at birth. I recently came out as trans (mtf) to my therapist and one of my friends (vaguely). I live in a progressive state, I know my household is cool with trans people. I know the friends I have (at least, the ones who count) would support it. I know what it is I want to do to express myself as a trans woman. The problem, however, is that I'm absolutely terrified of even beginning. I know, rationally, that I basically have nothing to lose by coming out and being who I am, but I'm just terrified. 

Prior to this issue, my therapist ""diagnosed"" me with depression and anxiety and ADHD. Obviously, being trans and being fearful about coming out is causing me to have some depression, but I guess I just didn't expect it to affect literally everything in my life. 

(I also wonder if I was just born being prone to depression. I can't recall a time in my life where I wasn't like this) 

Symptoms I've been experiencing include: 
Sleeping all day 
Isolating myself
Insomnia at night 
Procrastinating (literally everything, not just school. Sometimes I'll drive to the convenience store and then sit in my car for 30 minutes doing nothing before actually going in)
Suicidal ideation (I have a plan but no timeline and I don't think I'd execute it)
Neglect of hygiene (not so much bodily hygiene, but my room is pretty bad) 
Loss of interest in activities

There's more but I can't think of stuff right now 

The question I specifically want answered is; how do I actually start to do anything? My therapist keeps saying reassuring things, giving me small goals to achieve and kind of debunking all of my irrational thoughts and stuff, but there hasn't been anything meaningful in regards to moving forward. I can't even do the small things. I just want to know how people do it.

I feel like I'm sitting back and watching everyone live their lives while I'm stuck chest deep in mud of my own making.

So to avoid working I thought I'd go back to university. And what a bust that's been. 6 years in uni now, on and off. And I don't even have enough classes to be considered a 2nd year because I keep dropping everything because I can't get myself to go to classes or study. I go to one class each semester and that's my art class. But a degree in art won't get me anywhere, and it's not really something I want. If I'm in uni I want to go for a bachelor in psych or neuroscience. I'm smart, but have absolutely no motivation or drive no matter how hard I want it or ""try"". I've given up on myself ever accomplishing my goals. And I hate saying that because its so pathetic. (Not that I'd think that of anyone else in my position) 
Ive tried so hard for years to have stable friendships. It's actually been an issue my entire life; but in recent years every ""best friend"" I've had in my life seems to only want me in their life so they can dump their problems on me. I have 2 people in my life who actually care and listen, one being my counsellor and one being my ex, who I have a super weird, unhealthy, co-dependent relationship with. And then my family, but I'm too scared to open up to them. They know I struggle but we don't need to talk about it. And when I actually do find someone I click with, I avoid them and I have no idea why! I crave conversation and closeness but it seems like every conversation I have with people is surface level and my friendships NEVER progress past that. I see people around me interact with others, make AND KEEP friends, make meaningful connections and it just baffles me. I can't even have meaningful connections with my family, I'm just scared they'll know how bad my life is and be disappointed. Not even that it's just the worst feeling in the WORLD when they know what's going on with me. And with my siblings I want SO badly to have a good relationship with them that I overthink it and always blank out when I'm talking to them. It's not so bad with my brother because hes always talked a LOT, which I hated when we were kids but I absolutely adore now. I can feel close to him and like I matter in his life, because he wants to spend time with me and show off all his stuff, but when it comes to my sister I have so many emotions and things I want to say and do but never do because conversation has just never come easy between us and I'm SO nervous to spend time with her and come across as this stupid, awkward, hard to be around person. Her and her husband can also be really judgemental so that doesn't make it any better haha 
So many people around me are in stable relationships, marriages, having kids. Heck, my little sister is married. And I'm so happy for everyone but yeah, I'm lonely. I'm at that age too where my mom is trying to get me to find someone and family asks and it just reminds me of how incompetent and incapable I am. I'd love to be in a relationship, but no way am I in the position to be in one and I'm scared I never will be. 
I've slowly lost everything I had to offer, and no matter how hard I try I just can't get it back. Anhedonia is real, and makes NO sense. Take this example and apply it to everything in my life: I love colouring so much, and my mom even bought me a beautiful prismacolour set and books after I got out of the hospital because I ended up loving colouring so much. That was over a year ago and I haven't even finished a page. I'll open it and get lost in picking what colours, so I'll try and not care about the colours but then I don't like it and stop. Or I'll go so overboard my hand cramps for days and I don't pick it up again. 
And my life revolves around my weight. When I feel comfortable in my body I feel confident to actually do things, still not confident in my social skills but to me my tiny body makes up for it and I don't care how I come across, which in turn makes it easier to talk. When I gain weight, which happens often. I have binge/purge type anorexia and I'll take forever to get to a place where I'm kind of happy, and then something happens. like recently it was a 2 week vacation where I was trying to a) hide the ED from my dad, because at that point my weight was pretty low and I actually had a low blood sugar attack in Rome and thought I was going to die lmao and b) I didn't want it to hinder the trip with my dad. I can always lose the weight again, I can't get that trip back. So here I am, gained the weight and it won't come off. I'm right back to my old habits and even working out, which I rarely did when I lost my weight last time, but my weight is fluctuating between the same 5 lbs since January 1. It takes every bit of courage I have to go out because I gained SO much weight so fast that it was extremely noticeable. Christmas break happens, I leave, confident, seeming like I have friends, my body was so close to where I wanted it, and well on its way. Then I come back, 3 weeks later to the same weight i was at 7 months prior and busting out of my clothes. And I know nobody probably cares much, but to me all I can think is people talking about me, saying things like ""omg see how much she gained, omg she got fat and FAST, she doesn't even look the same"". And it's not even really about what other people think, it's what I think. I project hardcore, and I'm CONSTANTLY looking for affirmation of my weight thoughts, whether it's being that I gained or lost. 
Plus, and you probably could have seen this coming, I have chronic pain. Costochondritis and a multitude of issues with my back. Also, Im pretty sure I'm going blind. Idk, but my eye doctors not entirely sure what's wrong and all I see all the time is snow vision, bright light hurts my eyes, I can't see well in low light and its just getting worse. If I can't see I'll for sure off myself. 
I'm also struggling with the stupidest addiction ever, tobacco and weed mixed in a bong. There's a million names for em but we call them poppers here. As a young, niave idiot one of my ""best friends"" told me to try it while I was in a manic episode 4 years ago and it's been a battle ever since. I've stopped for 7 months before, but something stressful always happens and I always pick it back up. And like, I smoke HEAVILY. And I hate it. My lungs hurt, I have asthma already and struggle to breathe all the time, and I want to quit but I, of course, have a million reasons as to not. And I'm just in too low of a spot to try right now I think. But it's destroying my lungs and I'm so scared I'm going to give myself the big C word. 
Anyways, if you've made it this far, thank you. I appreciate it more than you know, I don't talk to people, not even really my counsellor. Bits and pieces of the real heavy stuff will come out every now and then, especially when I'm super suicidal, but I'm too scared to fully open up to her because she'll see how pathetic I really am. So if you read this, truly, thank you. And if you have any advice I'd really appreciate it. I don't want to die but I feel it's the only option for my life.

In a miserable situation,11100km,Ms1421,1676264638.0,3,1.0,"These emotions are so uncontrollable. It's getting worse with each passing day. I don't want to wake up in the mornings anymore because I'm feeling this heaviness in my chest that's causing a kind of dread. I'm not worthy to be around like this. I feel guilty that I'm still loved by my parent. I feel terribly guilty. I was trusted with making a decision and I let her down. I feel like I've hit a dead end.

I can't do the things I've been doing with so much interest. I've lost the passion and the enthusiasm for it all. All my issues were separate and at least manageable, until I fell into this and I'm now an emotional mess. I was a happy and confident person, once before. Now I no longer recognize myself. I'm having these goals but they're not lasting any longer. Depressive episodes are coming in intervals. I don't know why I allowed myself into this horrible situation. I would've been better off, emotionally at least, if not for this stupid heartbreak.

I can't be a burden because if not for my mom, I don't know where I'd be. I feel guilty. I was able to communicate, be with people and be happy and content with myself. Then, I've been in and out of these episodes every now and then. Now it's like I've fallen into this forever. I know everything changes and this isn't the end but surviving these moments is the worst.

To be abandoned in the month of love. To see every couple enjoy the company of each other, until last week, I too was happy that I had someone in my life, only to be slapped on the face with this life-altering reality. I wish, for once, that I had the mindset of these other people who forget the ones they love and move on like nothing ever happened.

I don't feel like an adult either. I feel like a lost kid trapped in an adult's body. I no longer am confident in my skills. I'm unable to eat with all the pain in my heart. I wish I suffered a memory loss, so that I can forget everything and move on, but I also know that life doesn't happen like that.

I hate having to wake up in the morning to go through the same painful moments, yet again. The only time I forget everything is when I fall asleep, until then I'm living a life that I don't deserve. I wonder why all the good and the innocent are dying, when I'm taking so much extra space in this world. The only person that cares about me is my parent and I'm trying not to hurt them but I can't suffer like this. There's so much going on in my mind and I have to face it all alone.

Feeling lost,110zo3u,Tall_Shirt_1111,1676263552.0,3,1.0,"I'm not sure where to start and I don't even really have a question. I'm 37F and just feel lost. All I've ever wanted in life is to have a significant other and kids and the kids part is pretty much out of the picture now given my age. (I get people older than this have kids but that is the exception not the rule and I prefer to just be realistic about things). I read other posts on here from people with depression and so often they say their spouse supports them so much or it's their kids that keep them going. I guess I don't get it. So many other people with depression and anxiety manage relationships and kids, and when I try, I go on dating apps, I try new activities, nothing. How do you do that? Still have people in your life and why are relationships just not something I'm capable of? Life wasn't exactly rainbows and butterflies growing up so I get that that affects me now and self confidence and self esteem usually hover around a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I don't really have any friends and not much family to speak of. I'm usually just so ashamed of myself that I find it hard to interact with other people, but I do try at times. There was a photography meetup I went to and most people were middle age or retired and I just think to myself, why am I the youngest person here and then I remember that most other 37 year olds are home with their families and kids on the weekend. I know there's all the other things to try like eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep, which for the most part I do ok with. I've tried therapy. Another thing that seems to just work wonders for others, but not me. I guess when I look into the future all I see myself doing for the next 10, 20, 30 years etc. is going to work and getting the dog out for exercise and that's it.

Life feels completely empty and pointless for me.,110oixi,persephon333,1676231502.0,15,1.0,"I have been severely depressed since summer of 2019, more or less.

Things briefly improved for about a 9 month stretch in 2021 when I met and fell in love with a fellow depressive, but that ended when she killed herself.

There isn't a single thing that I genuinely enjoy, or which brings me happiness.

I don't see the point of anything. I'm in a graduate program and I don't even know why I'm here. I don't see the point of getting an education, establishing a career, or making money. It all feels so tiresome. At the end of the day, what difference does it make?

I have no sincere interest in doing anything at all. Why exercise? Why eat? Why get up from the couch?

I loath myself, and find most other people pretty disappointing as well.

According to neuroscience, people are just bundles of neurons and sensory perceptions. It's probable we have no real control over our behavior. People that are ""good"" are just acting the way their internal programming dictates. So are ""bad"" people. We're biological machines. None of us have any inherent value. I don't wish anyone ill, but I also don't regard humans with any more affection or interest than I do a flock of seagulls.

Family only about cares about you because they have an evolutionary interest in ensuring the survival of their genes.

Romantic love is an illusion to induce reproduction.

Businesses destroy the planet just to produce a lot of junk.

Art has never saved anyone.

Everything eventually decays and is forgotten.

Intrusive Suicidal Thoughts,1111pd6,76589u,1676270582.0,2,1.0,"Disclaimer: Suicide is a terrible tragedy and I do not condone it. This post is not meant to idealize suicide in any way, im just trying to explain my brain and thought process. 

I'm 24F from Canada for context.

I literally cannot get out of bed to go for a simple walk. I only get out of bed to prostitute myself for 8 hours a day at a job I don't even like and then I do it all over again the next day because it's either that or homelessness when you live in capitalist society. I'm just trying to make it through the day without the famous ""i wish I could be dead right now"" thoughts. 

I am unhappy with my life. I make good money, but it's still not enough to move out of my parents. My job has prestige, yet it feels like I'm just a cog in the machine. There's no passion. And unfortunately, there will never be passion in anything I pursue - I have already come to terms with the fact that I will never be satisfied in life with anything I do. And so I might as well just stick out my time here on earth in a mediocre job making decent money, rather than switching jobs constantly chasing ""the next best opportunity"" when I know there will never be a ""best opportunity"" for someone so apathetic like myself. 

Although I wish I didn't have thoughts of suicide everyday, I do. It's not really something I'm in control of. Anytime I feel down, or am stressed (which is everyday) my brain immediately goes to suicide. Suicide is the easiest and fastest way to ""success."" in my brain. Why? Because at the end of the day, our entire life purpose and end goal is to die. What we do between our birth and death is meaningless on the grand scheme of things: the universe doesn't care if i exist or not, so why should i? 
We were put here on earth to die, there is no other purpose in life.

Unfortunately, me realizing the above has made me even more depressed. Knowing that there is literally no purpose in life, and finding out the universe doesn't care if I'm alive or not is shattering and it's truly no wonder to me why I'm so depressed and have intrusive suicidal thoughts. No wonder people turn to religion or substances - it's easier to handle than the truth. 

I really wish I could shut off my brain from these intrusive thoughts without having to use marijuana. Marijuana has been my survival mechanism for the past year, but it too seems to be having its own repercussions on my health. I initially started taking marijuana to help with health anxiety (I am a bit of a hypochondriac) but the risks have been outweighing the benefits now so I am going to have to quit - my tolerence to marijuana is so high, there is almost no use in using it anymore. Its affects on me are almost negligible now.

I just want to make it clear that I don't actually want to hurt myself, but I'm at a point where I just don't care anymore. It seems like I will continue to use marijuana until it causes me major health problems because I just don't care about my life anymore it seems. I don't care about my job. I don't care about my hobbies, friends, or family. I don't care about myself and I honestly sometimes think I would just be better off dead. I feel unworthy of life. I wish I didn't feel this way. It feels like I'm stuck between wanting to live and wanting to die.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1111pd6/intrusive_suicidal_thoughts/

"My long term girlfriend is depressed, and I don't know what to do",11139la,TAValentine3681,1676276681.0,1,1.0,"My (26M) girlfriend (25F, let's call her Sam) is currently going through an awful depression, and I'm terribly worried because her recent decisions. A trigger warning for topics of self harm and almost all forms of abuse. 

While I'm mostly here for advice on keeping our relationship healthy and ongoing, I'd like to give some context pertaining to our lives. I want to be as precise but also concise as I can, because I'm really worried about not just our relationship, but also her. I've consulted my friends (I didn't go into great detail, mostly out of respect for Sam's privacy) about what to do, and all of them say to stick with her. I will, I owe it to us both. However, I'm getting insecure, and any input, experience or advice anyone would like to share is very welcome. It'll be a long read. 

Sam and I met in our junior year of high school. After talking to each other a little, we realized we liked each other and went on a date. One date became many. Soon, we became best friends, lovers, therapists and basically family. Despite how disfunctional our families are, they still love and treat us as if we're already married. 

We'd have the occassional argument, where she'd usually shut down at some point and I'd try to calm it down, while I was always more oriented on solving the issue. Sometimes that was for the better, sometimes not, I still made a point to not cross boundaries or overdo it if the argument escalated, but in our 9 years of dating we only crossed them once or twice each, and got over it too.

My family in particular is disfunctional in rather poor, lower class way, while hers is more in the middle class suburban way, if that makes sense. Her parents are in a loveless marriage and are living a very yuppie-esque lifestyle they force down Sam's throat, while mine are often described as ""proud peasants"" and narcissistic to a degree. Both my biological dad, former and current stepdad were abusive alcoholic gamblers. I was raised mostly by my grandparents (we moved in with them after mom's first divorce) as my mom was working overtime for me and my 3 younger siblings. The second youngest is also terminally ill, and has been the main reason our whole house has been overworking itself to the bone. I love my brother to death, and it's not his fault he's ill, but his treatments and medicine are very expensive. I've been working odd jobs through all of highschool, mostly some sort of physical labor. 

Along with that, I've been struggling with major depression since I was around 13. I got sent to the school psychologist, and from there onward I was pointed towards seeking medical help. I was diagnosed at 14, and went through therapy until i was about 22. Until the end of highschool, I was very spiteful to anyone who ""got a shot at a life"" and was very pessimistic and just generally not that fun to be around. I'd get into fights, started smoking at 13, would get drunk pretty often and ran my mouth off a lot. Most the time I wouldn't want to get out of my bed, shower or brush my teeth, and when I did I made it my duty to show everyone hell because of it. My self esteem was low, I was very self destructive and self righteous to a debilitating degree and kept drifting through friendships and relationships to fill the void. 

After we started dating, it took a while for me to calm down and change therapists for a third time, finally resonating with one. With Sam's love and support, my friend's unwavering belief in me and my therapists advice and some cognitive behavioral psychomagic, I started calming down with time. I like myself quite a bit now, I work out, I shower, I act way nicer and have become somewhat adept at defusing my parents' fights, I support my siblings, I work, I study mechanical engineering, I play instruments, and all that jazz. Only relatively recently (around November 2022.) did I find a decent job, and through a bit of networking (and I guess nepotism) managed to secure a more than generous scholarship. My brother's time is slim, but I'm buying him more! Grandpa is on his last legs, but he's content and proud of me! I help my parents all the time and we have a chance at a better life! My band is going to record an EP this year, my friends and I are basically family now, I made amends with my dad and sometimes even check in on my first stepdad. Stuff is great.

All in all, things have been looking up for me, and I've been getting better. Sam's mental and physical health on the other hand have been getting worse.

Sam has PCOS, had an ovarian tumor and has issues with her thyroid. She's always been very sensitive healthwise, and tends to get sick easily. She's allergic to a lot of fruits, to some linens and some plants that are somewhat common where we live. I keep a list and am extremely cautious. Her skin isn't too fair, but sunlight and a lot of makeups are basically instant dermatitis. She used to be sorta chubby, far from fat, and we've been trying to help her lose weight at the advice of her doctor (as she was risking diabetes) for years to great avail. I'm very tall compared to her and I was somewhere between bulky and lean even in the beginning of our relationship, so she was pretty insecure about her looks. Coupled with that, she suspects she might be high functioningly autistic.

Her relationship with her parents isn't all that great. Her dad works abroad as some kind of civil engineer, and her mom switches jobs on a yearly basis. Her dad is avoidant and sometimes standoffish in a very passive - for lack of a better word - cowardly way. He likes to prod and mock others by ganging up on them, and is generally an asshole that appears as a fat jolly fellow to most, and has no respect for boundaries. Her mom is a female Patrick Bateman. Impersonal, cold, materialistic and so on. In these 9 years I've seen her laugh maybe 5 times. She had a rough life, and I respect her a lot. She can be a bitch, but she's well meaning. What I despise her for is forcing Sam to conform to many societal standards of beauty, conduct, education and so on. There's a line where it becomes unhealthy and she skips over it daily. Sam's confidence has always been very low through the years, but she just kind of rolled with it.

I went to a better highschool than Sam did, and she always had decent to good grades. I don' t mean better as in more expensive, I just had on average way better teachers, and that extends to college as well. She was way more hardworking than I was, and she was passionate about a lot of things. She devoted herself to pursuing either medicine or something in the liberal arts. She settled for lib arts, and was doing okay. She switched courses twice, I switched colleges twice, and we're dead set on master's degrees. Her opinion on college changes pretty often, which is to be expected when most of her teachers don't care about their students or the subjects they teach.

She has been working in retail for about two years, as her mom asked her to start bringing some income into their household and stopped giving her pocket money. I've tried multiple times to find her better paying jobs or something less tiresome, but she's dead set on it, so I stopped pushing the idea. Even with my scholarship deal I offered to get her involved, but she said she'd rather not. She likes her job for the monotony, but it isn't hard to tell that jobs can suck your soul out pretty easily, so I always try to surprise her at the end of her shifts with dinner or something small, or ""accidentally"" showing up during her work hours to buy something I could probably get at a lower price elsewhere.

We were both somewhat popular through highschool. We had a few friends each, and people knew us both. I was more notorious for the shenanigans my friends and I would get up to, while she was more just kinda friends with most people. A lot of her friends wouls end up going away or distancing themselves over time, and that'd bother her more than me losing my friends did. I'd drift through friend groups while she'd mostly try to stick to one at a time, and we were always surrounsed by drama, 9 times out of 10 not involving us. Her friends mostly came and went on their own but lasted for a reasonably long time even through college, while I managed to gather up a smaller ragtag group of friends that are still here to this day. We'd be friends with each other's friends, but we'd not pry too har sinto each other's lives in that regard.

I just want to illustrate her life as vividly as possible to explain how it all changed last year.

Last year, somewhere in late July or early August, I noticed a major shift in her demeanor and outlook on life. She started smoking around December 2021., which I at first discouraged as she has the worse health conditions, but she said she likes it. I used to jokingly say that she should ""give it a shot, as it's great stress relief as it makes you look rad"" and she never budged. Around August she started smoking about a pack per day. She now drinks more often, while usually she just did at parties or sometimes when meeting up for a coffee, and she got drunk for the first time ever. She used to be a very optimistic and outgoing person, but slowly she started shutting herself in, the way I did when I was struggling. As the new academic year began, everything started to spiral out of control.

She contemplates dropping out on a daily basis, and misses a lot of her classes, a few times narrowly avoiding failing the class at the mercy of her teachers. She has due seminars, presentations, essays and otherwise that were given to her around November. I offer to help her out frequently, either by compiling it all into a more comprehensive cheat sheet to study from or us dividing the labor between us. She refuses every time until the last moment. I never nag her about it or anything. 

She wants to quit her job more and more as time goes on, and over time she started actively disliking almost all her coworkers, even those she used to consider friends. She occassionally goes on a job hunt, but always ends up staying in retail. 

She started pushing away a lot of her friends, even very close ones that were here since before we knew each other. Some of them she refuses to speak to, and a lot of them came forward to me to tell me they're sick of her or that she just doesn't want to be friends with them anymore. 

Her dad quit his job around August and stayed home until a few days ago. He has been on his worst behaviour, and she now actively despises the guy, even going so far as to start bettering her relationship with her mom as she finds her more agreeable in the long run (she formerly hated her) and often fighting her dad on her mom's behalf. This backfires a lot, as her mom isn't that hot on the idea of open communication or quality time, and that leaves Sam pretty sad about her efforts to mend their relationship.

Sam has been ignoring her diet and workout regime so much that she barely even follows any today. I tried to nudge her into it again, but she doesn't want to anymore. I never criticize her for any of that, and still get her food and sweets, just a little less as her doctors have been saying she's been getting worse. She skips taking her medication often, and to a detrimental effect. Her self image is ruined. She had been very shut in when it comes to physical affection, which she used to value more than I did at first. She counts her calories one day, overeats on the next and vomits very often. I'm worried sick all the time. No matter how much her friends or I try to show her she's gorgeous, which she is, she still defaults to self loathing. We barely have sex, and often she feels revolted by being touched by anyone. I don't force her nor cross any boundaries. I'm not that sexual a person, but still even I get self conscious at times like these. 

Sometime New Years Eve, we laid down after a long Sam day. During that day, she pushed away the spaghetti bolognese and pancakes I made (her favorite) and said she doesn't want them, spilling the spaghetti in the sink. We watched a show we like, and she just got very mad and started yelling how shit it is, and how doesn't know why she even liked it in the first place. We went for a coffee at this coffee shop with like a million house specials, and she got two to try them out and just said we should leave without paying and giving the waiter some very backhanded remarks. She's usually not at all confrontational or overtly critical, but I played along for a bit. We went shopping, and after 2 shops she just sat down at a bench, lit up a cigarette mid mall and went on about how she wants to burn her clothes and this whole place down. As I did the same thing once when I was very upset and deoressed, I figured I'd join her, abd I lit up a cigarette too. And we talked about it until we got asked to leave. She wanted to drive, so ee got going. She sped like 15 over the limit and I asked her to calm down if something was wrong and that we should pull over so I could have a smoke. We came to her place, and her mom said something that caused Sam to tell her off very harshly. We laid down and watched some other show to turn our brains off. We made out, then she pushed me away a little, inslected my face as if she was disgusted, and went to the toilet. She came back and I asked what was wrong. She said nothing, and ordered me to lay down. She never orders people around, usually I'm the more assertive one but I seldom order people around. 

I finally snapped and asked what the fuck was going on. I recounted all the stuff from the day and said how worried I'd got for her through all of that. She'd be whiet for a moment and then say things that boil down to ""fuck them anyways."" I've been trying to be less preachy or judgmental since her depression started, as usually when something gets to a boiling point I'd demand we clear it up, be it with her or someone else. I tried to keep that down in fear of alienating her. She recounted every time she felt insecure, hurt or angry in the past 9 years, even twisting things she said or did into some sort of righteousness, and she kept telling me how for years she'd been putting up with whatever I'd want to do. I started doubting every piece of affection from the past years and felt very hurt. Instead of arguing back, I kept asking whether that's how she really felt and asking her to calm down. She kept railing me with very hurtful stuff, and eventually I snapped entirely and said the words she still repeats to me every time she feels depressed:

""Once you're ready to be an adult and own up to your responsibilities, then will you be an actual adult.""

She fell silent, I comforted her and apologized, saying I didn't mean it and I got upset. We finished the show and I left. From then on, she'd leave me and unleave me on a twice per week basis. In every conversation I'd be walking on eggshells. She'd go back on anything she said. She basically gaslights me out of believing in any form of affection she shows me, from petnames to affectionate gestures that she declares fake and forced anytime she gets upset. She constantly demands proof of something when she denies her affection to me, then says she was forcing herself anyways just to try again, and that it obviously doesn't work anymore. She'd be hurtful randomly, multiple times telling me how she liked me more when I was broke as now she believes she's worthless to me. Any affection I show her is a lie, according to her. Sometimes, she'd want to leave me at the first sign of either of us feeling upset about anything. Once it was a song, once a movie, once a thing my ill brother read out to us, once her friends having a fight with her, I don't know. 

She has contemplated suicide multiple times, and tried to slit her wrists right before Christmas. She, luckily, passed out before she did any real damage, and she made a quick recovery. I kept it a secret as she's ashamed of herself, her mom and I being the only ones that know. She says how she wants to do it almost thrice a week now, and nothing I say reaches her. I try being comforting and warm, she says I'm appeasing her. I try being calm and somewhat optimistic, saying it'll be alright, she says she doubts it. I try mirroring her and talking as if I was amidst a pretty bad episode, she says I'm tricking her. Twice, I even tried accepting it in conversation, because I thought she'd stop if I didn't react. The first time she changed her mind, the second time she said she's not falling for reverse psychology again. Once I even said that I'd kill myself too, and that just sent her spiraling thriugh every emotion under the sun. 

Her friends are reaching out to me constantly, and Jesus Christ, I haven't spoken to some in the last 9 years as much as I did in the past month. Almost everybody feels hurt by her in some way. None of us can reach her as it seems. My friends noticed how she felt too, and wanted to reach out. I told them to go ahead but be mindful of how she feels and not scare her. She refuses to takk to a couple of them now, qnd they'd show me what they texted. A few just wanted to talk. Some just sent memes (none relates to suicide depression or whatever) or otherwise funny/cute stuff.

This last time was this friday. This time she was dead set, but changed her mind last moment to still being with me. She finally seemee to accept some sentiments I've tried to impart since the beginning of her depression, them being that when people are depressed, a lot of the times they enter these dopamine cycles of abandoning everything in hopes of feeling better or how powerful the pessimism of the depressed mind is. She has been acting cold ever sinceybut acknowledges that she shouldn't try to make big life decisions when in the worst possible mood. Two times did she say something genuinely nice or affectionate. I'm afraid of even mentioning our relationship as I feel she'd go to town on me. I'm taking what little I can get and trying to be as good as possible. She wants to see me on Valentine's day. Frankly, I feel like I'm about to face a firing squad.

I never compared our lives to say my life is harder than hers or to imply otherwise. I never expressed any disdain because of her parent's financial wellbeing, and I don't feek jealous of her. I make an effort never to condescend. This fight was the first and only time I ever implied she was difficult to deal with. I don't throw insults at her. When I was in a worse place I'd get very insecure and want to be hurtful but I'd stop myself while/before I did or said something hurtful or stupid, often deescalating an argument instead. I could be harsh sometimes, but so could she. I didn't lecture her on how to deal with depression until she asked me how I dealt with it. I lost an ex to a suicide, and 2 friends too. I haven't  hyperventilated since I was a kid, and then it'd only be during traumatic events, and not even all the time. When all this started happening, I felt what I believe to be anxiety and paranoia's bastard child and felt my lungs shitting themselves. My depression lead me to serving in the army in what was basically a search for suicide, and I tried to end my life multiple times, never threatening her or anyone with it. My dad rammed his car into a tree and tried to overdose in front of me because of some fights we'd have. My first stepdad's daughter hung herself in our shed. I don't take depression lightly, and I've been trying to approach this as carefully and caringly as possible.

I never went on an ""It gets better!"" tyrade or invalidated what she felt, but from my experiences it's better to sometimes tell yourself to calm sown and breathe before making rash decisions. I never preached that to her, nor do I consider myself ""cured."" It's not exactly curable, but I believe with intervention and respect some healthy coping mechanisms can form. No two depressions are the same, but they can rhyme, right? 

What do I do? I want her to go to therapy but her mom refuses to accept it as anything past treatments for the insane, so she's iffy on the idea. She hasn't been diagnosed, but I'm pretty sure she's depressed. I'm not a professional, so I'm guessing from experience. If anyone has experience with depressed partners or feels they ckuls be of help, I'd greatly appreciate it. Also, since it's tommorow, Happy Valentine's day.

Tl;dr - My girlfriend is depressed and is on a downward spiral. I'm worried and I don't know how to make her feel better. She keeps leaving and unleaving me. I feel like I exhausted every possible option. She can be hurtful because of it, but I don't wanna give up on her, as I believe she doesn't mean it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11139la/my_long_term_girlfriend_is_depressed_and_i_dont/

Not sure what to do..,110s1gw,LexiStill,1676240545.0,7,1.0,"I am new to this platform but just wanted to ask for maybe advise or some input...I am 40 years old, no kids and haven’t had anyone in my life even a one night stand so still a virgin. Have 3 bachelor degrees in psych, nursing and recently in business but couldn’t due to high stress etc to work as a nurse so quit that and now work as admin assistant for a boss who enjoys to humiliate me and feel bad about myself every day…on top of it due to political situation in the world my mother is under tremendous stress and cannot see her mother and now she hates me since blames that not only that I am the reason she immigrated but also that I am useless since have no husband or children nor successful nor own a property.

I was honestly thinking about dying as seemed as the only option left..I don’t think I will feel better about abandoning my mother. I am crying now every day and believe that if I die maybe she will feel better and no longer obligated to stay and take care of me..maybe she even goes to see her mom and moves back home who knows?! I just know that no one will care..I have acquaintances but not close enough to care that I am gone, my parents will care about the costs of the funeral and what others may think but that’s it…not sure about my younger sister but at least she has her husband so she is not alone…

To kill myself though ..I tried several times but unsuccessful tbh really think I am a failure in that as well. If I only was stronger and braver, I would slash my throat! But I am a coward who is afraid of pain and the unknown..I am not religious and never will be since I am doubting everything but I wish I knew if there was something there, then it will make it easier to go and never come back. This life of mine is a waste of time and space, with all my years spent at school then volunteering it brought no connections, no friends, nothing really I feel absolutely done and empty. At 40 when all my schoolmates achieved a lot in their lives both professionally and personally, I have nothing to show for, I am an obese 40-year-old unattractive virgin with no career, no significant other, no children and now not even a chance of having them, health problems, lot of debt, no financial stability, and even my parents think I wasted my life and now it is over for me.

I (26M) am at a lost. I’ve been alone for my entire life. I’ve only had one adult relationship (that lasted 3 months) and one in high school (where my partner used to physically and mentally abuse me). It seems like I’m never enough for people to accept and love and I’m starting to get sick of rejection. I committed to myself while I was alone and I’ve been fairly successful but it’s still not enough for people and I’m at a lost what else is wrong with me? What do I need to fix so that someone can see me as a worthwhile partner.

For context (sorry if this comes across as braggy), I make a great living, I own a house, come from a good family, and have been improving my mental health actively since I was 23. However, it still seems like none of this really matters to people. It feels like everyone is looking for anything but me. 

This dark period started two weeks ago when my sister (whose only a year older), got engaged. And it just makes me feel like a failure. She has everything I do, and on top of that she has the one thing that I can’t seem to get which is someone who loves me. I’m just tired of people saying “be patient” or “just keep focusing on yourself” because I’ve done that 90% of my life and my patience has run out. Every time I’m on my phone, people I know are getting married and having kids and I feel like I’m falling behind everyone. 

Perhaps there is something inherently wrong with me that I just can’t see, and no matter my parents’ reassurances, I’m starting to feel like this is the truth. In that case, I think I’m ready to just hang up the hat and call it a day. I know I’ve done some great things in my life and I’ve spread joy in people’s lives so I know I’ll leave this world better than I found it. And I think I can die with no regrets knowing that.

Sorry for the incoherent rambling, again I have no expectations from this post. I just had to physically expel my thoughts because verbalizing what I was feeling was not helping. If you read this thing, I’m Sorry for taking up part of your day with my minuscule problems. I feel bad posting about my life because I know I’m the grand scheme of things, my life is blessed and I have a lot of privilege.

my depression made me hurt my friend. how should i apologise correctly?,1112kt6,silvverage,1676273967.0,1,1.0,"As you all know, recently there was a massive earthquake in Turkey and Syria, in which nearly 20,000 people passed away. 

I live in Eastern Europe, and didn’t keep up with the news as much because all of the daily tragedies all over the world overwhelmed my brain. I’m currently doing an outpatient program in a mental hospital, battling depression, severe anxiety, disordered eating and OCD. 

Because of my horrible mental health, I couldn’t find the energy to think about the world, or anyone else, because I was just trying not to kill myself every day, trying to get through the program which exhausted me mentally and emotionally beyond belief.

I have a friend who lives in the UK, he’s from Germany but he has extended family in Turkey. Because I was dealing with my own issues, I completely forgot to ask if his family was okay, or how he was doing. Yesterday, he posted a picture on Instagram saying something along the lines of “feel free to stop talking to your friends who have never once asked how you were doing after the earthquake”, and then listed some facts about the disaster, how many people lost their lives, etc.

I immediately responded saying that I 100% did not ask about his well-being and I am extremely sorry, but I’m not sure how I should apologise correctly. I want to make sure he knows I’m being genuine, not excusing my behavior and not making it about myself. 

I can’t just tell him I’ve been suicidal and depressed and mentally unwell because that will sound like an excuse, which doesn’t make it okay to neglect your friends. I’ve lost sleep over this, because I hurt my friend and I really want to apologise (I’m also aware he has the right to not accept it, which is totally valid)

How should I apologise/explain myself without it coming off as not genuine or selfish?

The world has become pointless for the most part for me.,110so51,sunflower_1970,1676242199.0,5,1.0,"I've posted about my health problems a ton on reddit, but I'm not thinking about that when writing this. The 2000s were so fun for me. There was so much to do online, I would play games with my friends all night and there was so much more variety in websites. People were generally nicer and more fun. I didn't have many friends in high school and I suffered from severe OCD, so it was a nice refuge.

The internet is now maybe 4 to 5 websites at most, all most people do is whine endlessly and about stuff that is problems they choose to latch onto, and nobody seems to just want to enjoy life anymore. Everybody is so spiteful. I try to go back to old games I played, but the playerbases are so small now. I don't look forward to anything. I miss what life used to be. People were happier even just a decade ago. Social media took advantage of people being impressionable and made them miserable and joyless neurotics.

Nothing happens in real life now. Culture is dead. There's really not much of a point to go outside unless you work. It wasn't like this always. Culture being this dead is a pretty new phenomenon and I blame it on the internet sort of standardizing and homogenizing people's concepts and thoughts. It dulled originality. 

2004 was the last year I was really happy. It's been almost 20 years since then. I remember even a few years after 2004 realizing that was probably going to be the last great year for me. I don't like how I was correct.

I been feeling pretty down lately, mainly how I see friends or how friends see me, i feel like I can be too talkative or try too hard to put effort into conversation, I also feel like I'm never first choice in their life, I can be selfish type of person but I always try to understand how they feel first as if they would do for me but at the same time I feel like maybe I'm being too emotional and have to accept that's part of life.

I lost a lot friends for different kind reasons and the more I try to find new people the more is harder to tell if we connect or mean anything to each other, finding friends irl Is not easy for me either, I don't know anyone who I can trust irl or someone I can rely on or go out with and drink with, I want someone I can hold hands with and kiss and spend time with love of my life, I want to be best at everything and yet when I learn about people I lose the sense of wanting this all..

Scared to start medication because my mood is better,110wp81,Confident-Speed-1438,1676254163.0,2,1.0,"Hello, 

&#x200B;

I am a 20 year old male, 115lbs. I have been diagnosed with Bipolar 2, OCD, GAD, and SAD. I have been struggling for a few years and recently just started getting better about a year of failing at the psychiatrist I was seeing. I stopped my medication around 4 months ago and I started taking 5HTP and Ashwagandha about a month ago. I am feeling better mentally, but I still have the signs of typical depression and my new psychiatrist recommends I start Luvox (100mg) with Methyl folate (15mg) and stopping the 5HTP. 

&#x200B;

I am a little worried to start a medication though, I don't want my mood to plummet because I do feel happier and healthier. I cant eat though, I am never hungry, I have been diagnosed with osteoporosis as a result of struggling for years to get a healthy amount of food down. I have ARFID along with some gastrointestinal diseases so that doesn't help. Along with not eating I have no motivation, I don't feel like working anymore or starting my own business which I previously did. I do want to spend most of my time in the gym now so I don't know if this is just a mindset change but I don't like it. Anxiety and overthinking are out of control, shaking no appetite for a many hours of the day due to this frequently. And the thoughts, jesus my OCD wont let me catch a break when it comes to creating the most fucked up scenarios of close people around me. 

&#x200B;

Maybe the answers obvious I just don't want to lose the ""happy"" feeling I think I have right now. I went on a round of anti psychotics that ended up giving me short term memory loss so I am scared to start something, is this the right choice, and if so is Luvox a good idea based off personal experience? thank you.

I’m not really sure how to put it other than I’m tired of crying myself to sleep every night over a guy who will never love me the way I love him. 

Ever since I was a like 14 I’ve never had anyone try to “pursue” (so to speak) me romantically or emotionally. Put simply, one’s ever found me attractive and now thinking back it fucking hurts. Being the literal only person who no one wants. I always have to be the one to make the first move and I alway end up getting rejected. The feeling is never mutual 

Everyone around me since high school. Dating, boyfriends girlfriends they friends. Then there’s me sitting alone per fuckin usual 


Fast forward 5-6 years to today, nearing my mid 20s, I finally feel as if I’m content with the fact I’m alone. To be somewhat fair I’ve always had issues forming emotional attractions and attachments to people, so most of the time since graduating high school it’s been meaningless NSA borderline emotionless sex. I’ve only had one relationship and it didn’t even last 3 months. It was more of a situationship anyhow 

then comes alone the absolute man of my fucking dreams. Like a literal king but per fucking usual. The feeling not mutual. It never is. He’s in a straight relationship and will never love me the way I fell in love with him.

Powering Through With Music,1110a93,Revolutionary_Pea571,1676265546.0,1,1.0,"I’ve always been heavily into music. I would create my own beats on my computer when I was younger, (around 7-12), and I took up clarinet as well (not my preferred instrument) from 9-14. After quitting that I started to feel empty so for my 17th birthday my friend got me a ukulele. I practiced it for a couple weeks and life started happening so I just never continued on. Fast forward to 20, and I decided to pick it up just because I missed having something that I loved to do. Though music did not cure my MDD, being able to mess around on the ukulele and put time into something I thoroughly enjoy helps to ease some of the pain. I know no one is judging me and it’s a time for me to let loose and give myself that much needed relaxation period. I’m taking up guitar as well, and it feels good to begin to fulfill my inner child dreams again. I’m starting to find myself again through music. Music is my breakaway from reality and right now the only thing that brings me joy, but that’s okay because music is everywhere.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1110a93/powering_through_with_music/

I work and support us both, and he maintains the homestead. Work has been very rough the least few months as I've been adjusting to a new move and a new environment. We're also very strapped financially at the moment, which I've accounted for but it doesn't make it any easier while we wait to regain a little financial stability. 

He's going through a lot of medicine changes, and I suspect some rough depression and feelings of hopelessness. I feel like nothing I do is helping, and It kills me to see him so miserable. I constantly try and offer solutions and check in to see how he is, but I've been getting more and more resentful remarks. I know he's just not in a good spot, but sometimes those remarks are delivered so spitefully and sharply. I feel so alone. All my friends and family are a long distance away now. 

I feel like all I'm doing is making it worse, and I'm starting to feel like a stranger in his life. I think... I have to give him some time to process and just be a little absent from him. Focus on myself life doing some yoga and playing my piano. Reading books, going for walks.

"Struggling with depression and anxiety, again...",11104bq,FragrantPace2650,1676264996.0,1,1.0,"18M. I started feeling like things were going to get better, and now I feel like I'm sinking again. I've never been as bad as I was 2 years ago, but I feel like I'm on my way. Trying to socialize is only demoralizing, and I feel as though something is wrong with me. 

When I rarely meet people, or am in a group of people, I just start feeling cold. Seeing them makes me feel disappointment and embarrassment. I feel more mature than any of them, despite the fact that I probably am not. I hate seeing them laugh, and have fun. All they say are ""X is doing X"", football this or that, or sex jokes. And I take jokes too seriously. Sex jokes make me feel extremely uncomfortable, and fill me with anxiety. And I apparently just look unapproachable and emotionless... my neighbor said I have no emotion in my eyes, and my facial expressions look forced. 

Am I just messed up? Am I mentally damaged as a result of my isolated childhood? No matter how much I try to escape the prison that is my own mind, I feel trapped. What is wrong with me? Most teenage boys from what I've seen are excited to try new things, go out, hangout with friends... and most I've seen behave so naturally, like they are real people with real feelings. They have sex drive, they have laughter, they have fun. 

I just feel anxiety, frustration, and disappointment. And I'm just a jerk for that, the people I see don't deserve the unfair judgement, the hurtful way I perceive them.

I'm losing my only anchor to reality,110z5z0,angrycocoafaebackup,1676261909.0,1,1.0,"I've always wondered how my death would play out. Not the action itself, but the mindset I will be in when it happens. I've probably ended my life hundreds of thousands of times in my own head. More often than not, I've had a bittersweet, calm feeling when I imagine the energy draining from my dying husk. I imagine the sins of my past, my hurts, my trauma...everything that has taken my life from me just washing away. Sometimes I can feel the gentle release whenever I am deep in thought.

I'm painfully aware that this romanticized delusion is my brains' way of coping with the idea of death because I don't understand it. I know that it's inevitable regardless of how long I live, unless there are immortals somewhere on earth that I don't know about. I know that it's a part of nature and that no one really knows much about it other than what is scientifically observed. Even though it's a mystery, it's still the only certain thing in life, and that is what is keeping my sanity in check.

I think that's why I'm drawn to it the way I am. Through all the abuse, the pain, the shame, and the constant inconsistency in my life, death has been an anchor. It's an anchor because it's the only thing that doesn't change. However, I've been finding myself unsteady. My depression has taken me down a path I've been on for quite a bit, but have never acknowledged. I'm losing my grip on reality. I keep seeing patterns in the world that don't seem like coincidences anymore. I find myself giving more meaning to certain objects or spending hours thinking about psychic abilities, Mandela effects, deja vu, high consiousness, etc. Basically, thinking about pseudoscience. 

It's frustrating because I don't want to think about anything beyond what I can sense. From a logical standpoint, it's just wishful thinking because a tiny part of myself does not truly want to die. But the majority of myself wishes that death would come sooner. I feel as though i'n losing the only proof of reality that I have because I cannot shake the feeling that there is  something that we humans have forgotten or just can't comprehend about what life and death really means...what they really are. And it scares me because I don't want there to be something else. I don't want hope, or the possibility of there being more to me than just my biology. I'm exhausted from the pain, the inconsistency, the misdirection and the uncertainty. 

Death is the only thing that I have that's real. It's the only comfort that I have. When my abusive parent died, when 2 of my school bullies died, it was proof that they were permanently gone and that I wouldn't be hurt anymore. Death is the cure for everything that is gross and wrong with this world, yet I question if it's as permanent as it's made out to be. I've envied the dead and dying for a long time. I don't know what I'll do if it turns out that there truly is more. I feel as though I'm trapped in this vicious cycle of pain and psychological torment in LIFE. I don't want to be trapped in death as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110z5z0/im_losing_my_only_anchor_to_reality/

"Need Advice- attempted suicide last week, got reported to the police by a friend, now I am scared to start school again.",110ywz6,dizzy_bee_,1676261119.0,1,1.0,"Hi. In a fit of hysteria I attempted suicide last week, I texted my goodbyes to people and as a last beacon of hope I called my best friend at 2:36am for two hours to help calm me down. I walked into school the next day like nothing happened. One of my friends who I’m having trouble with presumably saw the funny texts I sent and reported me anonymously to the police about my mental state. My parents got a call from the police and after school I got escorted home. My parents didn’t know I attempted suicide, they only got a call from the police that someone anonymously reported me.

So, I didn’t get admitted to the hospital. I did stay home from school to catch up on work and chose not to engage in social media or text anyone nonessential for the entire week. No one except my best friend and teachers knew where I was or why. Not a lot of people contacted me, not even one of my friends who I got into an argument with or the friend who reported me. 

So I’m going into school tomorrow and I’m scared everyone hates me or nobody will be happy to see me. Some people may be a tiny bit concerned but as far as they know I might have just been sick. And I’m tempted to text people after not seeing them for a week to ask whether or not they’re upset with me so I know whether or not to go to school tomorrow.

I am a school shooting survivor, diagnosed with PTSD- few days before my attempt the a lock down happened and I had a horrific resurface of this trauma and nobody was there for me when I needed them. I didn’t go to school the next day after that. I also had auditions a few days later that I spent months working towards and I got completely rejected. I had a performance for another thing on Friday and nobody talked to me, not even my friends. People have told me that I’m a very passionate, kind, and caring individual. I care a lot for my friends and have always been there for them and have done so much to ensure their wellbeing. If my compassion isn’t reciprocated then I become hysterical. All those events plus my friends abandoning me is what lead me to attempt suicide last week. I’m scared that if all the people that I care about aren’t happy to see me tomorrow then I’ll have a meltdown or worse. But I have to go to school, I can’t fall behind.

Do I text my friends to ask for reassurance that they like me so I can go to school tomorrow? Do I stay home? I don’t know what to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110ywz6/need_advice_attempted_suicide_last_week_got/

I wish I was never born,110u4o9,Impossible-Divide569,1676246300.0,2,1.0,"I’m new here and I just want someone to listen to me without making me feel guilty for having these feelings. 

I wish I was never born. A little backstory: I am the youngest of 5 kids all who are significantly older than me (eldest being 50 and youngest being 42). My mom had me when she was in her 40s and I’m sure my dad was in his late 50s or 60s and as a result of her poor health during her pregnancy with me (she didn’t take care of herself at all) and genetics I was unfortunately born with a congenital heart disease. I was born blue and spent a large chunk of my time in NICU and the rest of my childhood in hospitals for multiple heart surgeries. 

I was a mistake as my older sister told me. I wish I didn’t make it out of NICU or any heart surgery. I wish I wasn’t a burden on my family the way my older brother makes me feel. I wish my mom would’ve just miscarried me or aborted me. As a result of all this misery, my congenital heart disease has transformed into Congestive Heart Failure as of March last year. I’m so miserable, I have pain in my chest constantly, have to use an oxygen machine daily and to make matters even more worse for me back in 2015 I lost vision in my left eye and then a year later in my right eye due to Tuberculosis in the eyes (don’t even ask). From 2015-2017 I lived in darkness and I was so happy, living in my own world until I got treatment for it and now have vision only in my right eye. Although I’m happy I can see, my health has been so shit. I have a none existing immune system and due to meds & lockdown I gained so much weight and now I can’t stand to look myself in the mirror. My entire life has been put into a halt because of my health and I’m miserable. I hate having older siblings, they don’t understand that they had enough other growing up (they’re all a few years apart) and I had teenagers and college students when I was younger who were not interested in babysitting a sick kid. I basically had my imaginary friends and toys to keep my company. 

As of this month I spent my 25th birthday in the surgery room & ICU for major stomach surgery. I was forced into having a gastric bypass surgery for weight-loss. I have never felt more miserable and sad in my whole life. I wanted that surgery to fail so bad. And yet here I am, living still. This is not fair.. why does God keep me alive, I just want out. I have my major heart surgery in Dec and I pray everyday that I don’t wake up. I actually nearly died from another heart surgery in October of 2021 and it was the most peaceful I ever felt in my life. I wish God would’ve just taken my soul and let me move on. I’ve had enough of my family and my siblings. When I try to tell my eldest brother how he and my mom ruined any ounce of happiness ever had when I got my dog and they just fought with me constantly until I had to give him up for adoption within the week I got him he told me I should “stop playing victim”. I hated him so much in that moment, I held back all tears because I can’t yell or my stomach stitching might rip open. I will never forgive him or my mom until I die. Even before my surgery, my siblings and mom acted as if they cared all worried and shit, I don’t believe them. I wish I was fully blind again, so at least I could not see them again and just live my life alone with my imaginary friends until I rot away.

I don't believe there is anything that anyone could say to me that could hurt my feelings any more than they have been hurt already. 

People who claim to love me have a funny way of showing it and when I am being myself, it is like never accepted?? Or they think there is a deeper meaning to how I behave when there isn't. I just don't care anymore. Someone could literally tell me that they've always hated me and they wish I don't do well, and I would probably look at them and be like ""wail.... damn LOL"".

Life kinda sucks!,110xmwx,smkb912,1676257125.0,1,0.99,"I’ve never actually thought to post on this app before, and I’m not sure why, because the community here seems so genuine and down-to-earth. 

But anyway, I guess I just wanted to emphasize the point that making this post was really a last resort. I’m not sure know how much longer I can continue to live like this.

Can a person simply be too far gone? Are there people out there that are beyond help, fated to fail in life due to reasons out of their control? I’m a little worried I might be one of them. And, no, I don’t say this because I’m frustrated and defeated by my circumstances. The diagnosis I have (BPD) is a lifelong one. That doesn’t go to say that people with BPD can’t live gratifying and fulfilling lives, I just don’t believe I happen to be one of those fortunate ones who can. 

Obviously, I have to take some responsibility for how I turned out, but it’s probably worth mentioning that my parents never taught me how to deal with my problems because they were always too wrapped up in their own. I’m genuinely terrified that all of the behaviors I’ve learned throughout my childhood have created a foundation of permanent insecurity and instability that cannot be undone. Nature vs nurture, or something like that.

“Things will get better,” so I’ve been told. “Just give it some time.” Yet, here I am, 4 years later and still stuck in the same exact place with no reprieve in sight. Recovery seems like nothing but a far-fetched ideal when I realize that this is just who I am. I’ve been living under this delusion to strive for genuine happiness that will never come. 

Seeing people come and go in my life is too much for me. It’s like a wound that never heals, it just gets ripped open again whenever another friend becomes a stranger. I major in Psychology simply because I love people. The sentiment doesn’t seem to be mutual, though, because my friends and family see me as dispensable. There’s always someone they like more. The only real friend I had wants nothing to do with me after a falling- out and has since cut ties. And it’s completely my fault. 

I guess I just wrote this because I wanted someone to hear my story before I make any final decisions. It brings me a weird sense of peace knowing that there might not be anything after death. No more excruciating lows, abandonments, or betrayals—just rest and serenity. Things I rarely have the privilege of experiencing in this life.

If anyone is actually reading this, I’d like to thank you for taking the time out of your day to hear me complain. You’ve done more for me than some of my closest friends have done.

I now know why antidepressants have a black box warning...,110t4js,FlaaFlaaFlunky,1676243442.0,2,1.0,"I have A LOT of experience with antidepressants. fell into a deep depression in my early 20s and tried many of them. never had a bad reaction apart from a physical one to a TCA. managed to make it out back then with a lot of therapy, clinics and medication and did well for a few years.

in the last few months, my depression came back unfortunately. at some point (waaay too late), I decided to intervene. while antidepressants were a huge help for me, I couldn't recollect a particular one that was most effective for me all these years ago. so, I decided to ask my doctor for one I never had before (sertraline). has a lot of good reviews and I liked what I was reading. 

it took 2 weeks to send me into an incredibly dark, panic-riddled and alcohol-driven hellhole.. I first thought I snapped because I had/have an enormous amount of stress at work. thought ""well, I took them too late and now I'm in a burnout"". severe panic attacks whenever I woke up I could only get a handle on by guzzling bottles of alcohol. I felt so very strange. felt like someone threw me straight into hell. very, very dark. didn't get up for 2 weeks straight apart from going out to buy alcohol. it was so bad, my thighs started bleeding from the severe chafing I got because I didn't move at all anymore. at some point I realized that it can't be a burnout and immediately stopped the sertraline. I gradually got better again with every passing day. 

i was incredibly close to committing suicide. this post is not meant to be a bad review of sertraline. it helps a ton of people enormously. everyone is different when it comes to medications like this. this is just to say that you should be careful and that some symptoms may not just be a case of ""it gets worse before it gets better"". so, be careful, observe yourself and intervene if you feel like something is going severely sideways. i tried at least a dozen antidepressants in my lifetime and never had a reaction like that. but now I understand the black box warning thingy.

i'm on bupropion now which, at least for the moment, seems to be working wonderfully for me.

I’ve tried 13+ different medications at last count, and nothing has worked. Assuming I remembered them all, because my memory is so questionable sometimes. The depression has gotten steadily worse. I’ve had to go out on medical leave from my job multiple times because of it. And at this point suicidal thoughts are the norm rather than the exception. I’m still pushing on, no worries there, but they wear on you, like wearing a weighted vest every single day that gets heavier and heavier. Like an actual black hole living in your chest, gravity and all.

I see my own therapist every other week (I wish I could go more, but I can’t afford it). But aside from that, my support system is a joke. There are some people, sure. But I can guarantee that if I didn’t make the effort to initiate contact, I wouldn’t hear anything. Which, fine. I don’t want to hear my own shit, either. But I do feel profoundly alone. That there’s not one person who gives a shit about me to reach out to me first. Sometimes I wonder how long it would take people to notice I was gone. My guess is not until I didn’t show up for work. I don’t know when I’ll die. But I’ve resigned myself to the fact that it will more than likely be all alone.

If I do have one thing going for me, it’s my sweet cat. I love the little guy. He’s my world, and the biggest thing that helps me do anything. I know he is the one who would suffer if I didn’t keep living.

when i was little, i felt like i had a great work ethic. i had (& still do) have big dreams. i loved school and it was once so easy for me to do well. then when i was 16, my dad unexpectedly just passed away one day, literally, he just dropped dead in 2019. and my life changed forever. my personality drastically changed. i got a 1.5 GPA that semester because i could not keep up with how fast life was moving when i was stuck in the past. then the pandemic hit in 2020, and i developed an eating disorder to cope with the loss of my father. i thought that if everything were to go to shit in my life, atleast i can still be skinny, and that is something i can control (i was extremely wrong). then in february 2022, i tried ritalin & adderall for the first time and i became addicted. in august, i was shooting up meth & fentanyl (wow, how fast of a progression). anyway, i’ve been 6 months sober since then after overdosing on meth & my kidneys nearly failing due to dehydration. i went to rehab for 90 days. and now i live in a sober house. this is my first time ever away from home. my parents used to be my security blanket, my crutch, my hero’s that i could rely on for anything. and now everything has changed so much in just 3 years. i feel like i can’t keep up.

Biologically broken.,110wkxh,Jenry_Thy_Duck,1676253792.0,1,1.0,"This post is a generalized vent for some of my woes.

I didn't know I was depressed until I was a teenager, I had no real concept or knowledge of what it was. I had gone my entire life up until then clueless as to why I feel the way I do. Being properly diagnosed is a cursed blessing, for the understanding of my disorder was no longer an issue, yet the symptoms remained. From the night terrors that kept me and my parents awake half the night every night, learning disabilities, ADD and Tourette's, to my diagnosis of MDD, and various bouts with PTSD induced traumatizations. I have always felt this way. Being in the room to witness your parent's and physician's unanimous agreement that I have been exhibiting many issues consistently since I could talk. It is a reality check. Especially when it's backed up by your psychiatrist.

In a way it's almost funny, being able to recount every domino, when, how, and why they fell. Maybe I'm just sick, but how did no one see this coming? 

I hate how mental health is stigmatized, it's not fair. I didn't make myself this way, I barely remember most of the journey. Why is it that if I need help the only options I have are to systematically push everyone I know even further away by opening up and being real, or hope to the stars that the equally depressed person on the other side of this toll free number doesn't make me want to kill myself even more.
Why can't the air just be clean? Why must the clouds go grey? Why must I be extorted by my leaders? 
Why is that we allow ourselves to continuously take it up the ass instead of getting pissed and doing something about it?
Maybe if the world I was born into wasn't such a shitfest it would be easier to ""perk up"" and ""shake it off"" as they say. 

If you read this and got anything meaningful out of it, thanks. No one usually listens to me when I rant. 

If you feel similar or can relate, allow yourself to be reminded once and again that you aren't the only one. You may be lonely, you may be alone, but I can promise that your feelings are not so reclusive.

"Scared to take Zoloft again, but its getting too hard",110wa7x,raviolitoreddito,1676252863.0,1,0.99,"Like many of you on this thread, I struggle with chronic depression and severe anxiety that is starting to gradually cripple my life. I will spare you my sad story as it is just the classic "" I feel no joy, Im terrified all the time, I wanna go away ect ect"".

I have been in this boat before and managed to get out of it with a daily 50mg of Sertraline (zoloft) during and after covid. It changed my life for the better as it allowed me to not feel ANY anxiety and realize that my brain was being extremely irrational about everything. I was finally ""normal"" again.

Until.... I wasn't. Last year, despite my daily intake, I fell into a DEEP depression, it was my lowest point and it's not hyperbole to say it nearly killed me. I was never that close to the edge, so I made a huge decision as I had nothing to lose, I stopped taking my antidepressant.

What happened shocked me, maybe it was just placebo but I started feeling much much better after stopping taking ssri. It was so drastic that I began suspecting I might have had the side effect of suicidal ideation that can come from it.

I thought I was finally out of the water as I no longer was going crazy. I concluded the SSRI made me suicidal so I thought I'd just stop taking any medication.

But now.... I'm back down in the pit, it's awful. Now I'm facing a HUGE dilemma...

Do I wing it and try to live my life despite my growing insanity? or do I take my medication again and potentially face increasing suicidal thoughts ? 

I'm just scared, I'm already on the edge and I don't know if I could face those thoughts again, but there is the chance that I would feel marginally better and actually get out of my irrationality

What do I do ?  It's been a year and I still have two full bottles of 50mg zoloft ready. Should I take it? ?

I just don't know.....
Sorry if this was asked before and my rambling, Thank you for reading, any comment is welcome and I hope you have a wonderful day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110wa7x/scared_to_take_zoloft_again_but_its_getting_too/

And there is almost no time that i can be truly myself, because there are always people around. And then i have to change myself again to fit in and meet the expectations of everyone. 

But i fail miserably everytime i try to do anything right. I just disappoint everyone, including myself.

And i know the reason why i don't get any better. It is me, I'm the problem. It's my fault that I'm feeling like this. Because i could do things to better myself but i don't. This problem is not resolvable, the only way to get rid of is to kill it and worth that also myself.

Struggling with no friends m23,110q57j,FigInteresting9181,1676235617.0,2,1.0,"I’m a male 23 years old and and from a relatively small town. My high school graduating class was 120 people roughly and we have all known each other since grade 7 or younger… so it’s a rather small community where everyone knows everyone. 

Anyway during elementary I was severely bullied. The bullying consisted of verbal and physical attacks. I had absolutely no friends and I was hoping this would change when I advanced to grade 7 where we transfer to the junior high which at that time had all kids in my town grade 7-9. (We had 5 elementary schools all k-6 and all students transferred to a single junior high in grade 7) unfortunately the main person who was behind my bullying ended up being in the same grade 7 class as me and continued the harassment. I showed up to school every day and got beat on and made fun of. I still have graphite in my leg from when he stabbed me with his pencil. (He would do this multiple times a day walk to the back of the class sharpen his pencil at the pencil sharpener then walk by my desk with a freshly sharpened pencil and stab me with it). Anyway as you can see I had a horrible time in school. Which affected me and made me severely depressed and had major anxiety. At one point I couldn’t do anything without thinking I was going to be made fun of for it. 

Fast forward I’ve only ever had 1 relationship and that started in grade 8 as a friendship with this girl. Anyways she was my only friend and we were really close. It was the first time I’ve ever connected with anyone and I fell in love with her. One night in grade 8 she hurt herself really bad (she had a different bf at the time too) I called her and we talked on the phone for 5 hours until 4am in the morning on a school night. So we were very close.
 
Fast forward again and it’s grade 10 and she fucks my identical twin brother. Which destroys me but she snaps me crying saying she wants to talk so I go to her house and I’m sitting outside in my truck and she comes outside (she has a friend over that night and her friend was left in her bedroom alone) anyway she comes out and she bawling saying how sorry she is etc. (we were only friends at this time). And she told me she loved me but she was afraid to tell me since she thought if we dated she would loose me if we broke up (she never told me that before but she knew I always liked her so I always joked we will end up together eventually) anyway she’s literally my entire life at this point in my life so I forgave her and somehow we started dating a few days later (again after she fucked my twin brother) then I was made fun of having my brothers sloppy seconds the entire time we dated. And 14 months later she breaks my heart and ducks literally the 6 guys who actually would talk to me at school within 2 weeks of breaking up. So the friends I thought I had were gone the gf I loved broke my heart and destroyed me. And I had no one.

Fast forward again I’m now 23, graduated when I was 18. Haven’t talked to anyone from high school since graduation. Haven’t hung out with anyone socially non work or family related in 5 years. Haven’t had sex since I broke up with her. And am seriously questioning if I will ever have friends or find love again.

The worst part is I still love her and think about her all the time. She was literally my everything. We talked everyday and she was the only person who never ever made fun of me and treated my like a human.

I graduated college in 2020 and struggled to find a job for 10 months. I was offered a job that was pretty rough, didnt help me career-wise. During this time I was very depressed, and gained a lot of weight. I just stayed in my room most of the time after work. I stayed for 8 months and then found another job that would give me experience. The pay is still low but the supposed trade-off is that you are getting experience that you wouldn't get if you had no experience. it is a rotational program and most of the people in the program are straight out of college so sometimes I feel old. I have been there about 10 months and just asked for a raise from $23 to $25  which I don't feel like I deserve it and kind of regret asking. 

I feel behind sometimes because I am 25 and I still live with my parents. I also constantly think about what is the next step or just what is next have no clue. This all starts to lead to regret.  Remaining positive is hard.

So mid or late 2020 my living conditions got really bad and my Mum was considered unfit to take care of my sisters and me due to Her depression, so She was forced by law to give me and my sisters to our family members, a thew days before this happened, I was walking down stairs to tell my Mum about something, but I noticed a cut on Her wrist, I was shocked for a few seconds, but then called Her out and asked if it was on purpose, she said no, I didn't believe Her and I felt ever so slightly sad and a bit worried, if I remember correctly my hands were shaking a bit. So, when I was forced to go live with my with my grandma, I got tricked into going there, She said ""it'll just be for a week"" so I went there, as soon as I got there slowly started to develop huge problems with my memory, focus, logic, and over all cognitive behaviours and I also think much slower. And my mind changed to this surreal state where I always feel like I'm in a video/dream. This slowly got worse. Whenever i heard people talk about cutting or killing or anything like that, I'd tense up wrist and think about my mum, this also made me tear up but I could never cry, because my emotions are all numbed. I can barely feel a fraction of what I once felt, and I've lost passion for everything, including music (which I used to obsess over probably because I'm autistic lol) I've lost my concept of time, days feel like months/weeks most of the time. When I moved there  I also had no desire to eat, everything I ate tasted like nothing, I felt nothing, and I felt like nothing. I was so lost, the way my brother treated me didn't help either, (my brother lives with my grandma) He pretty up much bullied me, constantly shouted at me, He even threw me other a table for not listening to what he said. Walking outside was my only escape from everything, my anxiety was worse it's ever been, I constantly felt it. I kept questioning what the meaning of life is, and constantly came to the conclusion that nothing matters, I kept wondering if anyone care if I died, an i was convinced that no one would care about my death. This got so bad to bad the point that I was considering walking in front of a bus that was coming up, I always stopped myself for some reason. I even considered cutting my hand but never did. Now I live with my Aunt and I even have my own room, I think the only thing that's gotten is that now, I can taste food and now I even rely on it for comfort,  and I Also don't feel ""suicidal"" if you wanna call it that. But all of these problems still affect hugely, and it's extremely hard to reflect and think on anything, or learn anything, this concerns me because I'm in college and I'm finding it extremely hard to think logically about anything, and I'm worried that my memory is so bad that I'll forget everything I've learned, I'm waiting to see a psychiatrist, but I've waited months and months and the NHS still hasn't gotten back to me.

How to interact with my roommates after months of depression?,110ugmh,transistentSquirrel,1676247247.0,1,1.0,"So here is my situation:

I have been living in student housing for a while, 12 of us the kitchen. Just to clarify there people themselves are nice, no complaints.

Now I am very introverted by nature, and recently (meaning the last few moths) I have been quite depressed, meaning leaving my room and honestly sometimes even my bed was difficult. This started right after I moved in, so I never really got to know my roommates. But from what I gather a lot of them are really shy and only awake at night or visit home a lot - only like 5 of them regularly use the kitchen. 

After basically disappearing for months right after I moved in it feels super awkward to now resurface. I have been steadily feeling better for about a month, but have felt too self conscious to actually use the kitchen. I kind of just leave my room to use the bathroom and live of instant ramen and stuff (I know, not my proudest moments). 

So basically my question is: How do I get over it. I know technically that no one cares about me and they are also just all living their lives, but somehow I am finding it quite difficult.

I’m 18 I’ve been depressed and suicidal for as long as I can remember. I’ve had ptsd since I was fourteen but probably had it before then it’s just that’s when the manipulation turned into punching me in the face and I got out of that family.


I was agoraphobic for two years because I was terrified of leaving the house and running into my father and what he would do to me if he saw me again. Two years ago I moved across the country to live with my uncle and now I’m no longer agoraphobic but depression has been clinging to me. 

I stopped going to classes in the beginning of the school year I was able to go to work regularly tho mainly because I felt intense guilt about letting my boss down. 

A couple months ago my counselors were able to get me into a special Ed room to work in (previously I had been coming in late and sitting in a conference room because classes were too much. I kinda made two friends but due to me coming in late I hardly saw one and the other had anxiety so befriending them took some time. Then one day I saw the first one come in to class with a friend and I said hey let’s play Tetris together and we hung out for a period and I befriended their friend, then the next day I was made aware that the person I played Tetris with was not the person I thought they were and was just a completely different person I have mild face blindness. 
So I then had four kinda friends.
But I was still struggling to get to school and was depressed then last month a small group was taken out of school to like a psy camp two of these kinda friends went and I was allowed to join the little field trip. I don’t remember all the details but I had fun and became friends with one of the people that went with me. 

I didn’t go to school one day that week and received an email from one of the spec Ed teachers that my friend had been worried about me, since then I haven’t missed a day I’ve barely been late. I became friends with all four of those aquatinces. When the new semester started I was forced to pick new classes and chose to attend ones that my friends were in as I don’t think I could handle being in class alone.


I’ve been really happy but I’ve been doing reckless things two weeks ago I quit my job with no notice I loved my job and my bosses and my coworkers I still don’t know why I did it I just didn’t want to anymore.


Last week I started cutting I don’t cut when I’m depressed I’ve tried it it didn’t help but now I’m cutting every day.
With my ptsd I don’t have flashbacks I have what if scenarios and sometimes those involve me thinking about fighting my abuser and then I have this anger and need to inflict pain and I know from my past if it doesn’t get inflicted on someone it’ll just build up till I snap  I hate myself for being this monster for being just like my father it starts to feels like theirs poison in my veins and I need to get it out because it hurts so much so I cut I cut because my veins hurt and because it’ll stop me from hurting others",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110uewc/i_have_gotten_out_of_a_depressive_slump_but_i/

Feeling hopeless about myself and the future,110t87t,Sarahkins6,1676243721.0,1,1.0,"TLDR a series of things over the past year has brought on anxiety and depression, and I don't know where to go from here. 

I am hoping that writing all this out in itself will be therapeutic and helpful, but if anyone reading has some advice and coping techniques to share, then even better. 

I hadn't intended for this to be quite so long but, it was helpful to at least write everything down. 

I (33f) live with my fiance (38m). In my 20s I moved away from my home town and since then moved around a lot, for my old job. I worked my way up to be a store manager of a chain cosmetics company. I'm a naturally shy person but, challenging myself in that job really brought me out of my shell, as it was the type of place where you're encouraged to be confident bright and bubbly. It wasn't always easy, but I did it and I was proud of myself. 

Whilst working there I met my fiance online, I wouldn't call it long distance as it was only a 90 minute drive. Then covid hit, we moved in together, and after a year of that my priorities changed. Retail was getting even harder with late nights and travelling back and forth was tiring. So after a lot of planning we bought a lovely house in the town he lived in (I had saved since age 18 to buy a house so to do so with someone I love made me massively happy and proud), and I got a new job working from home. Its very different to my old job and some days can be a little dull but, as an introvert I feel quite at ease doing it and am doing well in the company. 

Things were fine for a year but then my finance lost his job. He was given a chunk of money when leaving so we were OK for a few months, but it did take him 9 months to find a new full time permanent job. We were able to pay the bills every month by being careful, but it was touch and go for a while and a massive worry. I got a second job in a supermarket which has helped but I have hardly any free time now. Today is my first day off in 4 months. 

He then got a good new job in November last year, however shortly after a string of things happened. My gran passed away, and though we weren't close this put into motion a lot of strained family issues. We had been in the process of trying for a baby and, though the financial situation wasn't great, we aren't getting any younger. Because nothing was happening we had already previously started asking for medical advice. We finally got results back that it's unlikely that we will conceive naturally, which was devastating. The problem is that even almost 3 months later we still don't know specifics. We don't know specifically what the issue is, what our odds are, what our options are etc. I know the NHS is under pressure but despite chasing its been incredibly hard to even get an appointment. For 3 weeks my partners drs surgery weren't even answering the phone. 

3 weeks ago my fiance lost his job again. I was just about to give up my second job but now can't. My 2 jobs don't cover everything but we do have some savings, but of course they won't last for ever. I'm also concerned that our savings may be needed if we need to go private for fertility treatment in the future. We have paid the deposit for our wedding very for July 2024 but I just can't see how we can afford that huge expense also. He is looking for and applying for jobs every day but only certain types. He says he needs a job with a certain amount of money for our future which I do understand but, it might take a while to find a job like that and I can't see what would be wrong with getting ANY job at all in the mean time. They are hiring at my 2nd job at the supermarket but he won't apply. We've talked and argued about this one thing for so long but it always ends the same. He says he needs a ""better"" job than that for our future, and that he knows I work 2 jobs and am exhausted but that he is thankful for all my hard work, and that he is trying hard. I just tell him I don't understand why he can't see that any money at all coming from him is better than no money.

What has really affected me though is the sudden death of my cat. We have 2 other beautiful boys but our youngest was hit by a car and passed away on new year's day. It's really knocked me for six. I was already feeling pretty crappy because of everything else but that was kind of the final straw. I had been with him since he was 8 weeks old and am completely heart broken. He was only a year old and still a very small cat, but was cheeky and adventurous and so vocal. The the house feels so empty and quiet without him.

Over the past 6 weeks in particular my mental health has taken a nose dive. I do have experience of this but it's never felt this bad before. I'm struggling to eat because the basics feel like too much effort to face. It started with not eating for a few days at Al after my cat died as I was so upset, but I've not gone back to normal since then. I feel like I am constantly on the verge of tears, as if I have a wall around me that if I don't actively use all my energy to keep up, I will fall apart. It takes every ounce of my strength to get up and do these 2 jobs and I'm at the end of my tether. This morning for example I woke up at 830, but lay there awake for 3 hours not doing anything, knowing I needed to go and eat something. I know keeping myself as fit and healthy is key especially if we want to have a healthy baby in the future. This is what we desperately want so if I know this, why can't I will myself to do the basics? I have some issues with skin picking that I've never quite solved but now I'm getting worse with it.  I feel guilty about feeling this way and unsupportive of my partner, as these are obviously issues that are affecting him too. 

I feel like after everything that's happened, that I'm a different person to the one I was a few years ago. I've lost my resilience and self confidence. I feel like every moment is taken up either by worrying about money or the future, and have now started going down paths I previously thought I had dealt with in therapy (past relationships, regrets, lost friendships etc). I've run out of energy. I had a panic attack in town yesterday. A manager in my 2nd job last week asked me to cover the customer services department for a few shifts and I gave myself a panic attack thinking about it. I used to run my own store and have gone from going on stage at regional meetings (scary but I did it) to talk about what I'd achieved in my work, to someone who has a panic attack at even the thought of something changing in the slightest. I feel like I've lost myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110t87t/feeling_hopeless_about_myself_and_the_future/

I want a dad...,110nuqj,T-Boy200,1676229774.0,2,1.0,"TW vent

Hey! I grew up with an abusive dad, he used to hit my mom, do drugz, drink and stuff. He got into prison often for selling and taking drugz and for hitting my mom. Still I saw all of that I sometimes miss him...The last time I saw him was almost 10 years ago. The last thing he sent me was a birthday letter on my 8th birthday. He said that he'd always fight for me, at that time he was in prison again, he said that as soon as he'd get out we would meet up, talk, go eat Ice cream together and have fun like we used to have. Before that letter I haven't seen him for 3 years. He said he would change and get better for me...he didn't. I really thought he would change but time past, that letter I got from him was 6 years ago...I haven't even seen him once that time...My mom used to get messages from my uncle (brother of my dad) saying stuff like:,, He's not in prison anymore..."" :,, He has bla bla bla..."" :,, He did bla bla bla..."" And ofc my mom told me...I used to play the strong, not interested one and be like:,, Okay..."" And not saying anything more. The last news we got from my uncle was 2 years ago, so idk where he is, with who he is or what he's doing...It's hard for me to look at kids with their dads having fun and even sometimes I'm jealous of my bestfriend. I make jokes about me not having a dad, trying to hide how I feel and the fact that I actually miss him. My mom used to have a partner that time where my dad left..They were together for 5 years and I found a father figure in him...but then they started fighting a lot in 2020 and broke up in 2021...I was fcking down, it was the time I realized that my dad is not gonna come back, that my dad hitting my mom wasn't normal and the fact that I saw it was making it even worse...In germany we were in quarentine at that time...I think the other countries too but home schooling made it even worse for me. I sarted to not care about school anymore and to not pay attention anymore...I sometimes just left the meeting saying that I have headaches or that my tummy hurts a lot and started crying as soon as I closed the laptop. I asked my mom for a therapist and we got me one...But at first I had to get diagnosed. Turned out I have depression and a post traumatic stress disorder...After I got diagnosed I went to see a therapist, she's a very nice person and I get along with her very good! Now she got pregnant and the baby is gonna come next month. We said that I'll stop going to therapy bc I'm feeling well at the moment. The thought of missing my dad wasn't there till now again. I don't think I want my dad back I just wish for a dad that would have stayed with me till now but life is unfair. My mom is very young and is going to study in april, I'm alone most of the time and when she's going to study I'll be alone even more.

The funny thing about my situation,110ll8i,BasicBihTearGas,1676224066.0,2,1.0,"I remember during my first year at uni, for the first few weeks, I had no friends at my university residence. I had friends on campus yes but not in the apartment block I lived at. Mainly because I’d avoid all the parties and get togethers they had, and go straight home to my room after class. I enjoyed the company on myself and was content with it. 

Then one day, this random dude shows up at my table in the dining hall, and decides to sit next to me. Introduced himself and commented on how I always sat and ate alone. Then before u know it, we became friends. 

Two weeks later, this dude sees me coming back from campus, carrying a backpack and a few textbooks in my hand. He invites me to a small gathering he had at his balcony. I left my bag and books in his room, and decided to enjoy the evening with them. Knowing I didn’t drink, he pushed me to drink with them. Until I got drunk. Which is when he decided to make his move on me. 

And at that very moment, it made sense why I was so untrusting of people. How avoiding everything and wanting to be in my own space is the only way I am ever really safe. At that very moment, I thought of my 7/8 year old self who lied down helplessly and cluelessly while being raped. My 10 year old self who just let it happen when 2 dudes in my class raped me. How I had let myself down again by allowing myself to yet again be in a similar situation. 

I’ll never how defeated I felt in that moment. And although I was able to stop him before “it” happened, just seeing that happen to me for a 3rd time by the age of 17 really destroyed me.

Depression is unknown factor and heavily ignored by many culture and societies , for many people they dont have reason to give thought about concept ""depression""

and if you assume am gonna attempt put fair clear definition buddy you wrong < sorry ask dr google > or keep reading to help you make your own definition

for depression , nasty feeling which keeps evolving inside someone and cant easily go away is what leads people into Internal Suffering with pain humans obligated

to make choice and usually the choice holds huge impact into someone lifes and others who build human attachment , dose this always have to be for anyone with pain ?

couldnt give perfect answer for this obvious question with simplistic answer , real life is complicated and people want posivtity from themselves or others ..

otherwise you be pushed away slowly into bein alone rotting .

personal experience with depression made me realize life is simple process and why death is scary ? 

are we suppose to pretend remaining alive is somethin important for us ?

these simple question dont have clear answer to give for people in need for answer about wonders in our world , but what I suppose to know is we need keep fighting

I thought I would finally be happy when I was popular.

just my thoughts,110kbwi,realcesspoolofshit,1676220950.0,2,1.0,"Ever since the loss of my parents and a long term relationship, I have been very isolated. I moved to a new city where I knew no one. I have no extended family or siblings, so it's just me now. 

I didn't want it to be this way. I wanted to have friends and positive relationships but I quickly learned that my life and financial circumstances put me at a disadvantage to meet people living more positive lives. More often than not, I found myself around people who saw my grief and wanted to promote a shared depression and toxic lifestyle, even when I was actively working to overcome it. 

I thought, at the time, the best thing to do was to find a new group of people but the problem is me - not in the sense that I look for these types, but that my life circumstances continue to be viewed in such ways that I continually have neutral to negative experiences with new people, both positive and negative types. 

I also feel it's like pulling teeth to have regular conversations with people that may lead to an established connection between us. More often than not, they see or hear something they pity about me and reach out with empty sympathies and polite words about how I can talk to them anytime. Yet, when I do try to strike up a normal conversation, even if it relates to their life and interests, the responses reflect an intrusion on their time. At first I thought I'd lower my expectations and these very brief stilted conversations would lead somewhere, but they never have. Still, they'll pop up with sympathies the next time they feel inclined. 

Now that I'm older, people have established friend groups and families and their priorities will always lie with them, which I'm not upset about - that makes sense. I am upset that the reality of that fact is that it's another obstacle placed on trying to alleviate my personal isolation. I'm also mostly talking just about isolation and not a romantic loneliness as if I cannot even find a decent friend, how can I expect to find a positive and interested romantic partner? 

I don't think I can live forever, or perhaps even another decade, in this type of isolation. I think humans need meaningful interactions and I think most people get that from built in relationships of family, friends and partners. Although there's temporary relief interacting with people at work - it's not the type of socialization that really fulfills a person and I think after so long, it starts to damage you: your social skills, your perception on the world, trust in other people etc.

I have a pain in my leg that came on when I was walking, at rest I’m fine but it’s been stopping me from walking so I’ve been alone in my home for the last 4 weeks, just me and my mind and slowly my mind is winning if not has definitely won, I feel like I’m throwing in the gloves and about to give up. I’ve already jumped to the worse case scenario and I’m tired of this. I’m so tired of everything.

The death of...ME...,110jtu0,unworthy-1,1676219657.0,2,1.0,"I think it's tragic that one can live 54 years, give everything they have to this world and the people around them (time, energy, expertise, compassion, love, gratitude, hard work, great attitude, resilience...etc) and still end up at the bottom of the heap. My zeal for life is absolutely gone. I have nothing that propels me forward. With 100% certainty, I know that my life will be an absolute failure from now on.

It's so horrendously dark in my mind, that I celebrate those lives that are lost during catastrophic disasters around the world. You might hear a story about a young child that was ""saved"" from the wreckage, but that child wasn't saved, it was unfortunately rescued in order for that child to go on and live a tragic life. The best aspect of their life, was that they had a brief, fleeting moment where the world saw them on the news and had false compassion for them. Honestly....if I was that child in the demolished building, I would hope I would be found dead. I would hope to never be found so I could just pass away. 

So, when I hear that 258 people died in a plane crash, I'm happy for them. I'm happy that their pain and suffering is over. They don't have to live another day on this God forsaken planet.  Life is a curse. Life is like having your face against a grind stone without respite. Why would we be so selfish and celebrate a ""saved"" life? If we were completely and utterly honest about it, we would proclaim...""%$&#...they're alive still. Now they have to endure a horrific existence and end up dying anyway...someday."" And....the ones that end up living with permanent physical injuries?..omg..they were better off dead....for sure. Life is NOT this blessed thing we make it out to be. If you think life is some God given blessing....you're dead wrong. 

I wish my parents had aborted me before I was born. I truly wish that. I hate life and all that comes with it. I once had a great outlook on life and then because of various circumstances, the ""reality"" of what life REALLY is  hit me full force. I came face to face with the wretched reality of my own existence. So...when you hear about a human life being lost in the wreckage of whatever natural disaster befalls us or a plane crash, feel a sense of peace for the soul or souls that were lost....not anger, not resentment, not pain, not sorrow....but feel that they were saved from living a tragic, meaningless life (like an unexpected gift). If there is a God, he takes those that he loves and leaves the rest to be tortured in LIFE. It's not the other way around. Look at it that way and change your perspective. The death of...ME...is real. I feel like I'm dead on the inside. I feel that I have nothing left to live for and I just have to drag my face through the mud until the day I die....then I'll just go to hell and it will be even worse there. Hope for an early, unexpected death. That's where the blessing is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110jtu0/the_death_ofme/
I skipped an anatomy quiz that accounts for 15% of my grade.,110owek,Constant-Meat257,1676232463.0,1,1.0,"I’m stressing out over the quiz I skipped and made it worse by lying to the professor (they asked for my reason of skipping) saying I was sick and now he’s asking for proof and at this point I’m just stressing out even more and I’m over thinking it probably but I ended replying I don’t have proof and they’re probably gonna end up giving me a zero for the quiz. To start from the beginning, I’ve been studying for this quiz for about 3 days and pulled an all nighter but even then I wasn’t feeling mentally well and it was as if I didn’t study at all, so three hours before the exam I finally broke down and let out everything I was feeling and just decided then I don’t want to do the exam my hearts not in it and I just don’t have the mental and physical energy just to end up crying or stressing again WHILE I’m taking the exam. 

For context: I’ve been dealing with closeted depression and suicide for some time now and even now I’m thinking to myself was I just being lazy or was that a good enough reason to not do the exam. Now I’m scared of failing the class and whatnot and it’s making me  regret skipping.

The Son,110j3jz,Iamnotmyselfbut,1676217816.0,2,1.0,"I just finish hugh jackman movie, the son

And it's so great, I really feel like his son cause he is a suicidal guy like me, but for me there's one thing that keep me going until now is my MOM, even though I sometimes I just want to rest (dead).

8 years ago, I was bullied in school and I have an abuser uncle who lives with us, I can't tell my mom anything about it cause if I told her she would just blame herself (that's what I think) I got depression at my senior year and just getting tried of going to school and I just go to computer game house and just play all day then go to school, it was even worse when I started to poke myself with a silver knife above my thigh so no one can see it. 

I don't like white boxer so I always have a black one and I am the one who's doing the laundry so no one sees my blood in my boxers.

Sometimes if I hurt myself, it makes me feel relieve that all my anger and fraustration is now completely gone and I mostly just cry myself to sleep. 

But seeing this movie makes me feel wanna live again but not for others but for myself. I feel sad if those people are going to get hurt if I leave them even though they left me behind. 

Most of the time I can't sleep cause I overthink a lot like when I just gonna close my eyes but I am not asleep starts at 10pm until 5am just to overthink about the past or the present of what I shouldn't done that moment or what am I going to do when I am old, If am I going to be happy, or get married or even have friends???

I am a bisexual man who is a closeted man and I was rape when I was 3  by my cousin and more years to come (different people), I was the target of pedophile people because of my looks and my body.
I didn't know what was right or wrong when I was a baby so I did not know it was wrong. So I sometimes hate myself for liking a guy or wanted to have sex with them cause I likes girls but I like guys too. 
I was abused for my whole life that I wanted to kill them but too afraid to do anything and now it's too late cause I am already a 23 year old guy. I still haven't come.out to my mother nor my friends or anyone.

I have friends just my cousins. But most of the time they are busy trying to get on with life but with me I feel stuck.

Most of my classmates from highschool unfriended me on facebook, I don't know why. 
I was just bullied in highschool for being to optimistic, I like to be happy when I was in 7th grade until 9th but people keeps making me down and making me lose myself confidence and then my uncle went home and the reason was he was bankrupt and didn't have money so his I was the kid who get punch at 6am for not waking up doing chores instead of going to school, if I had a extra-curicullar activity he will bersek cause I am always not in home, I always have no time to help in the house cause I am a student and when I sometimes rest on some weekends I sleep until 11am but he did not want that, so he just punch me and mock me until I start crying and what's the worst part is he will shout ""stop crying you are not a woman you are a man"" that sentence makes me angry, why can a Man not cry??? Aren't they humans too? (My moms not always at home cause 5:30 in the morning she always leave to go to work/ an hour or two drive to work).

When I was in my 11th grade, it's just like a bomb came after me, I was so energetic to go to school but one day on january 6th I just feel tired and lost and it didn't feel right going to school so I starting skipping for weeks became months, I transfer to like 5 different school in just my 11th to senior year
At my senior year I was still skipping school but sometimes walking for hours (3/4) hours of walking makes me calm, I sometimes go to the cemetery and just sleep there cause most of the time there was no people there, and I like it. 

and I feel bad to my friends too cause because I got depression I started to not talk to them in years until now.

I stop myself from hurting when I came back to my country and reunite with my friends. They know I got depression so sometimes I feel guilty if they are just hanging out with me because of my illness or they feel bad for me. I never cried infront of them though.

I can't bring myself to go to the doctor cause I am afraid and I don't want people to mock me or make fun of me. Cause I tried going to the doctor once and they gave me some pills so I can go to sleep peacefully, and my family and relatives know that I got depression they just look at me like I was crazy and they just always said that ""DON'T BE SAD YOU'RE JUST YOUNG"" there's so many opportunities you will get, why are you sad? You have a home and a family, you always have food on your table. 

Not once they told me if I was okay, instead they just made a decision to judge me and told me that I should be thankful that I was born.

So Lucky to Have Parents,110nknu,Lone_Pebble,1676229054.0,0,0.5,"Yesterday, I just got told that I was killing my parents by my mother. She’s told me this before multiple times throughout my life, so I’m not as hurt as I would’ve been; however, I can’t help but feel both infuriated and saddened by it.

In her “speech,” she said how both she and my father are still paying for doctor’s bills from a couple of months ago in addition to the medicine I have to take. (I have to visit a specialist semi-annually in order to get medications for a congenital condition I have.) She then goes on to say how both of them can’t go to a doctor because then it’d cost more money and open “a can of worms.” Following that is her saying that she might have a stroke because of pain in her legs and my father is experiencing GI problems. Then, for the last nail in the coffin, she alludes to how difficult it’s going to be to pay for my schooling, but how they’ll have to “find a way,” which would’ve been comforting if it weren’t for the exhausted and begrudging tone she had. (For context, I want to go into medical school and hopefully become an anesthesiologist.)

Now, she started this after coming to my room, so I wasn’t doing anything that would’ve warranted her saying this. After that, she stopped for a brief moment to tell us to go eat since my dad was home, and she’s obsessed with having us all eat together “as a family.” (I might vent about that at some point.) So, not wanting to escalate the situation, I went to go eat. However, my father was still unpacking from work while I was already eating, so my mom takes the initiative to continue the “speech.” Thus, I couldn’t leave since I already committed to eating in addition to not wanting to create a scene, forcing me to listen to the whole thing until she stopped the moment my dad came out to join us.

Of course, I should be grateful for having parents because here are some kids who don’t have parents and have to bounce through the terrible adoption system! I just love having parents, regardless of how much they make me want to kill myself! :)))",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110nknu/so_lucky_to_have_parents/
What I’m doing with my life?,110nf89,ikezz-,1676228657.0,0,0.5,"I just need an advise. I’ll try to make this short and simple 

I was born in a rich family that owns very different types of business all relate to pharmaceuticals products . 

That said, since I have memory I was teach to do the exact same thing as my brothers and parents to keep going the family business. So I got my college degree and being working with my family around 5 years but I don’t feel like I love what I’m doing. 

I left my family business and move in to my girlfriend house with her parents, currently I’m depressed, I’m short in money, and when I fight with my girlfriend all goes to shit (that’s another story, but it’s relate to cheating maybe she is looking things I can’t offer as before ) to the point I want to kill myself but I’m scare to suffer.


So, what should I do? How can I start from 0?

I was a super happy person before I met my girlfriend, i went to the gym, assist to church, my parents were happy with me I was focusing on my future. 

-edit: to be honest last year I was focusing to get this girl so I spend all year with her to the point that I gave all my money in things that she like, but now I feel really bad that all that effort was pointless; and I’m not leaving her because I have panic that she will cheat on me if I stop focusing on her.

You know when you’re at the point where, anything, and I mean anything, that could be said to you or happen, can trigger all these depressive emotions and suicidal thoughts? Yeah, I’ve been feeling like that for a while. A king while actually. My anxiety medicines and my antidepressants finished a month or so ago, and I slightly felt better so decided to stop cold turkey. Yes, I had to deal with all the withdrawal symptoms for about 2 weeks, but I was genuinely feeling abit better. 

Recently, about 2 weeks ago, I started feeling all bad again and all depressed. I contacted my psychologist (who is the universities recommended doctor, by the university therapist, for students she can’t handle or she feels need further treatment). I contacted him, about how I’ve began feeling worse, and he hasn’t replied and I understand probably how it’s a free service he does for the university and he’s probably busy, but I’m waiting for his reply about what to do to feel better again. 

So, I’ve not been feeling like buying clothes when we go out as a family. I don’t feel like buying shoes when they (parents) offer. I don’t feel like driving my car around (driving is something I like and enjoy). 

Today I mentioned as a joke to my sister when we went for grocery shopping, how I hate grocery shopping and find it super boring. My mum heard. She goes, “yeah, even life you nowadays hate. If you’re depressed, go fucking see a therapist, stupid”

I kept quiet. I immediately began feeling bad and unwanted and that they’ll be better off without me. Ontop of that, my mums aunt has come from overseas and wants to meet my mum and the whole family today before her flight tomorrow. Right now, I just feel like sleeping and not waking up.

I’m ready,110nbzp,Nrohtrc,1676228428.0,1,1.0,"Life sucks, I’ll never be happy. Things just keep
Getting gloomier, especially with how things are right now with our country.  I make good money. 80k a year. I still don’t have enough money to make myself happy. I will never have what I truly want. Even if I made 300 K a year, it would not make me happy. I am missing something else in life that I will never have. I will always be alone, it’s who I am and I’m the only one that can change it but I don’t know where to start. I am starting to gain weight. I have always been skinny. Every time I come close to getting what I want which is to have someone in my life, I ruin it. I am a mental abuser. I am super inconsistent with the way I am. One day you will like me and think I’m the greatest. Then I have a “down” day, where my inconsistencies show and then you hate me and you are blocking me on Facebook. I have been like this since I was a kid. I’ve never held onto any friends. Every friend I have made I have pushed away. I am the only one I can change myself. It almost seams impossible though. I am 28. I never thought my life could get this low. I try to remind myself that a lot of other people have it way worse. But even poor broke people still can be happier than I am. Maybe because they found love, I would rather be happy with somebody and live in a rundown apartment, but enjoy who I am with than to have $1 million house. Every girl I’ve ever talk to you has liked me one day then the next day stop talking to me and blocked me on Facebook or whatever and I am unsure why. I even try my best to stay consistent and keep my mouth shut in. It always fails. I can’t see myself growing out of this. Every time I have changed I’m consistent for a while and then a down day comes, and I lose all motivation. I am really good at stuff. I figure things out pretty quickly and become good at whatever I do. However, having friends or having a girl in my life is always something that I fail at. I don’t even want to try anymore because I always ends up making me feel worse. It’s every single time that I start talking to a girl. . As much as I want it to work, I will never be happy. I’m very glad that the only pistol I  own is disassembled. I could get so low sometimes that i ponder the idea of doing such a thing. Of course, it’s selfish to do that. My dog, my mom, and some other family would only be passed on the pain that I have. it would not help me, and it would not help relieve the pain. These are such dark days. I don’t even want to get up anymore. Here I am complaining when people have way worse situations. but I would rather be homeless living on the street and have that one thing that I missing in my life. I will never have it, every time I’ve came so close, but I ruined it somehow. There’s no point in even trying to start a new relationship because I know it always ends. I wish somebody could help me. There is no way anybody could help me, it has to be me. But I am a selfish, unstable, unpredictable , psychopath, inconsistent, multi personality, really, just a piece of shit who deserves the worst. Things I’ve done in my past, live with me forever. I deserve the same thing you have done to others. I do a lot of driving and even though I always avoid the accident I wish that a big semi truck would just run me over. The thing about kill yourself is, it’s not easy. It will hurt and you will regret it the very last second. Even if I did find someone who wanted to be in my life who I actually liked. My jealousy and my psychopath mind will just hurt them in the end. I have never physically hurt anybody in my life, I’ve never even been in a fight.
I am a mental abuser, eventually I would not get what I want and I would push the person away mentally and my vindictiveness will make them hate me. It happens every time. I really hate who I am. There is no changing who I am. I could mask it. But eventually, my bad side comes out. I stole from my family at 28, I’ve never done that since I was a teenager on drugs. Even if my grandma never finds out that I took four pills from her, that’s something they will always live with me for the rest of my life. Someone who trust me, and I steal from them. There is one thing I had done last year that will also live with me forever. I can’t go into the details, but I deserve the same thing I did to that thing. How could one’s mind get to that point? It almost seems unreal like it didn’t happen, but it did. It started out small then grew into a life ending.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110nbzp/im_ready/

But this is the time of year where every facet of society reminds you constantly how alone you are.

Every attempt I make to feel less alone only leaves me feeling more alone. Despite the effort I put in to meet people, it feels impossible to connect with anyone. It's gotten to a point where I've realized aside from family, I have literally no friends in my town. I have no friends within 5 hours of my town. And whenever I go out to meet people, I come home feeling depressed and more hopeless than if I'd never gone out at all.

At first the new job was very stressful. The hiring mgr wasn't my mgr but someone else was. This person caused a lot of drama in the work place. I was stressed out and started interviewing again which burnt me out. All of this sent me into a depressive anxious state. I started smoking weed again to cope and became so dissociative.. I neglected my relationship with my girlfriend and started arguments.


That toxic manager stopped showing up one day and I was enjoying the job for once. But I got a job offer that wasn't remote and took it cause it paid a lot better. I wasn't even thinking of my relationship.

The new job sucks also. I just wish I kept my cool at the previous job and stuck it out and moved in with her. Just let the stress not get to me. 


I lost my original job that was great, probably burned a bridge with the previous company and now I'm in a job where it's nothing what they promised, all the aspects of my career I enjoy I don't have in this role. It's a soul sucking mega corp hell.


I keep wondering how great my life would have been if I just prioritized her during all of this like I should have. I thought I would marry her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110h7c8/i_ruined_my_amazing_life/
trigger warning suicide,110m3mp,dopeassbitch23,1676225324.0,1,1.0,my ex boyfriend committed suicide recently and i feel so guilty for being upset about it. it was a middle school/freshman year relationship so people say “that’s not a real relationship it doesn’t count” all the time. but he was such a good person and i messed up because i was immature and we never got to talk to fix things. it had been 3 years of no contact and now i’ll never be able to. he also has a new girlfriend who is the sweetest most amazing girl so i feel like i’m not allowed to be this upset. yet he was my first love and it was young love so it just feel so empty now. i feel so selfish for feeling this shitty. for valentine’s day in 8th grade he gave me a necklace that he and his mom made for me with a picture of us in it and i never had the heart to throw it away. it’s now on my keychain. i guess what im really looking for is assurance that i can feel as shitty as i do and asking for guidance on how to respectfully grieve without upsetting anyone else. i just can’t stop crying over this. also this isn’t me falling for him again for anything like that it’s just i now feel a part of me is missing even if we haven’t talked in years.,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110m3mp/trigger_warning_suicide/
I just want to sleep.,110ak57,secy_Fox2021,1676189353.0,5,0.86,"I want to start off by saying i’ve never tried medication and i’m trying not to because of family beliefs but i’ll do what i need and can at this point. 

Sleep feels like it’s getting further and further away from me everyday. I (20f) have never really worked full time before october 2022 due to always being in school and being relatively young for not being in college. 
Side note, up until my high school years I’ve always been a lively athlete in school. Before covid affected us all, I would say I was a very active person all around and balanced in life. Now I’ve spiraled into not enjoying much in life and even going as far as to say i’m an introvert who prioritizes sleep over social life. 
I currently am working as a stylist around 37 hours (I was working overtime but it was so brutal I had to let my managers know I need more days off. My job still ended up giving me more hours lol.) every weekend without vacation for a few months due to so much clientele in this season. I want to add that my job has recently moved into a new building with marble tiled floors replacing the shock absorbent wood as well as 2 extra floor stories that is in constant use due to how large the new store is. Sometimes they can be accommodating and help while other times it’s just overwhelming. I truly feel like now us as stylists can’t catch a break and my body and brain can’t keep up with all the stress. At first working there wasn’t as bad but it seems like moving into the larger space has made into a business way too fast paced for what we do. Battling with depression and anxiety is getting really difficult as this is just the main issue i’ve been dealing with. 

All of this causes me to have an unbalanced home life since i don’t have any motivation or energy to do anything anymore except eat food and enjoy what time i have with my bf. I’ve tried waking up earlier, sleeping earlier, taking naps reading at night, working out, changing my eating, etc… to the point i was going to have a sleep study conducted.
I’ve figured out what works for me but I can’t get a single one of the things done when: 
1- my mental health is rapidly declining since new move
2- i get off usually a hour a two late every night 
3- i’m not very disciplined on my routines
4- i feel like every time i have to start a new task i MUST finish the last few. especially if it’s only a self care task. then my brain really doesn’t prioritize that. 
5- no motivation
6- i keep randomly waking up or just not being tired enough to sleep for hours. by the morning time though it never feels like enough sleep, even if it is. 

no. 4 is a really big mental block for me because i’ll stay up doing these tasks when i can’t sleep and i haven’t realized it until last year. if anyone has any advice pls! my body feels like it’s breaking down more and more each day. and as i’m writing this i’m experiencing my no sleep issue as it is currently 3am lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110ak57/i_just_want_to_sleep/

I lost interest in everything I’ve done, and generally just numb. I decided to go to a psychiatrist and she prescribed lexapro. I was supposed to take 5 mg, but due to health anxiety I started at 2.5 mg. That night was horrible: I was so anxious I couldn’t sleep, my heart palpitations increased and I felt nauseous and sweaty. I decided to stop since then, but I still feel the effect of the drug. To be fair, the symptoms might have been worsen because I received a sudden anxious news that day. My depression has been worse than before: I lost my appetite and my ability to sleep 7 hours fully. I feel weak all over my body, and shaking all the time.

Is there anything else for someone who's life is impossibly worse than a dying cancer patient's?,110cia0,Otherwise_Remote2592,1676197106.0,4,1.0,"I need to know what I can do before i consider killing myself because I'm at a loss.

I'm 27 and a male. I live in Shithole, New Orleans. I have no money, I have no way to work, I have no car, no driver's license, nothing. I have emotional issues to the point where I've been fixated on not being about to overcome them. This is due to the fact that I don't have a backbone nor am I willing to do anything to fix my mental state because everything that's happened to me is continuously getting worse by the day and I can't do anything about it because I'm stuck, mentally and physically. I have zero confidence in myself and I will never make it in the real world. I literally know nothing any average human being has already accomplished and I have no inhibition nor skills nor training, nor college (because its a fucked up bureaucratic cycle that in order to get a fucking job, I have to pay money I'll never see in my life to learn how to EARN money I'll never see in my life) 

I never had a job, I have only had minor training in a bike shop that went nowhere because I had no confidence or will in myself to continue to being a better human being. I found out I'm diabetic even though no one told me until A YEAR AFTER I contracted it. I have made no impact on anyone's life in a positive way and I have no control over my life. MY mental education is the equivalent of a fucking kindergartner despite me graduating high school (I can't even do basic fucking math) 

I am in a broken fucked up situation that I can't escape. I can't even be homeless. I would rather be fucking homeless than to continue going through the shit I am and I've attempted twice already and I cannot do it. I'm too weak willed and I'm pathetic. I can't count on any human being, I have no trust in any human being, and I hate everyone because the people who I am suppose to count on has endlessly fucked me as hard as possible to the point where my mental stability is completely tarnished. Now I am so fucked up mentally that I get unreasonably angry and overly stressed out, even on the littlest thing. I'm a constant screw up who can't do anything right. Social workers, officials, whatever services that are meant to help me has done nothing but waste what little life I have in effort and choices. I am not given any outs in a emotionally claustrophobic because the people I have to live with are both over 40 year old and they are less responsible and less trustworthy than fucking 5 year olds. They both are involved in drugs, shady shit, and always bringing homeless and drug-dealing motherfuckers in my fucking house despite the fact that it always ends in someone having shit happen to them or me. My aunt is the reason why my life is fucked up and has been fucked up for the past 10 fucking years and she wants to play the fucking victim like a fucking 5 year old child.

Lets these shady drug dealing mother fuckers in my house doing whatever the fuck they want, getting us caught up in this needless fucked up bullshit, and her fucking psycho boyfriend who fucking punched me in my fucking eye to now where I need surgery or else I'll lose my fucking vision, but you want to know what she has to say to that? ""You should have stayed out of my business"".

I'm in her business, even thought hat fat piece of shit keep bringing that cocksucking drug-using thug in my house to fucking argue, antagonize me, fucking yell out like fucking maniacs, DESTROYING SHIT WE CANT AFFORD, and fucking slapping her fat stupid self silly, but when I try to end this bullshit, I'M the one in the wrong for bothering that. Fucktard did get arrested after attacking me, but his cocksucking mommy paid for his bail before I even had the chance to know that I could fucking press charges on that dicksucker. Speaking on that, fuck Louisiana's law force and fuck the dumbass laws in this backwards ass cajun-ass piece of shit. I am in a literal fucking tight position and every fucking one of these fat hick motherfuckers wont do shit because apparently, if they live in the house, you can't kick them out, and they can do whatever the FUCK they want. EVEN AFTER I TOLD THEM MY AUNT TRIED TO GET ME TO FLUSH SOMEONE ELSE'S DRUGS  WHILE THE POLICE WERE OUTSIDE, THEY LITERALLY DID JACKSHIT ABOUT ANY OF THAT AND TOLD ME TO FUCKING DEAL WITH IT. THE CRISIS TEAM, THE POLICE, THE SOCIAL WORKERS, EVERYONE. AND THEY TOLD ME THERE'S GOING TO BE FURTHER PROBLEMS IF I KEEP CALLING THEM OVER THIS.

FUCK THIS BULLSHIT. Look it's a hell of a lot more fucked up situations I've been dealing with for the past year, including this cocksucker drug dealing piece of shit tweaker she let live with us for a year who did everything to make my fucking life a living fucking nightmare and whenever I complained, SHE LET HIM DO WHATEVER THE FUCK HE WANTED DESPITE ME NOT BEING ABLE TO SLEEP FOR 4 WEEKS IN A FUCKING ROW.

I also have another issue where they just let these drug dealers and homeless motherfuckers in my house and roam around like they own the fucking place, knowing this shit is not allowed. You wanna know what ended up happening?

The previously mentioned tweaker had people SQUAT under my roof for MONTHS without ANYONE KNOWING ABOUT IT. And when I finally kicked them all out, I found out those cocksuckers and crackwhores and drugusers WENT THROUGH ALL OF MY GRANDMOTHERS SHIT AND MY SHIT IN STORAGE AND STOLE OR USED OR MISPLACED OR DID WHAT THE FUCK EVER WITH ALL OF MY SHIT AND NOW OVER A HALF OF MY GRANDMOTHER'S CLOTHES AND BELONGINGS SHE HAD FOR DECADES ARE COMPLETELY USED UP OR GONE. AND I LITERALLY CANNOT DO A GOD DAMN THING ABOUT ANY OF THIS BECAUSE THAT FAT PIECE OF SHIT LET THAT MOTHERFUCKER LIVE HERE FOR FREE WITHOUT PAYING A DIME, COOKING AND EATING UP MY FUCKING GROCERIES MY GRANDMOTHER BUYS FOR ME, LETTING THESE CRACKWHORES BURN UP MY SHIT AND FUCKING WASTE MY SHIT AND DO DRUGS AND SHIT DESPITE THE FACT I KEPT TELLING HER TO STOP WITH THIS SHIT, AND THEN SHE ENDS UP PUTTING ME IN A FUCKING MENTAL PLACE FOR A FUCKING WEEK WHERE I GOT INJURED AND NO ONE HELPED ME AND ENDED UP NOT GETTING A GOD DAMN THING FROM IT COMPLETELY WASTE MY FUCKING SHIT ASS FUCKING TIME.

OK, look, let me get to my point because writing all of this shit is absolutely traumatic and every day I have to live with this endless tragedy to the point where I keep talking to myself like a crazy person over it. I panic over every little thing and the way I'm wording this shit and venting like this makes no logical sense to anyone (including me) because there's too much fucked up shit that endlessly runs through my mind. I'm slowly but surely going fucking insane and I promise you that I will become schizophrenic by the time I turn 35 because of how much mental damage this is causing me. Every single day I think about all of the shit that happened to me in the past year that I consider the worst year of my entire life. THAT'S a fucking honor compared to the shit that happened to me before.

I am trying to get some sort of income and I have been attempting to get Social Security for the past 15 years. EVERY ATTEMPT, EVERY COURT APPEARANCE, EVERY LETTER, EVERY FUCKING MENTAL PLACE THEY PUT ME IN, EVERY FUCKING DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT, FOR ONE FUCKING REASON OR ANOTHER, DENY ME EVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME. NO MATTER HOW MUCH I STRESS OVER HAVING TO DEAL WITH GOING TO THESE PLACES AND ALL OF THE FUCKING ISSUES AND SHIT IT CAUSED ME, THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY REJECTED ME FROM GETTING BENEFITS OF ANY KIND. MY FAT ASS CUNT OF A SISTER WHO SELLS DRUGS AND FORCED ME TO LIE TO PAIN DOCTORS IN ORDER TO SELL PILLS PRESCRIBED TO ME, HER FAT FUCKING ASS GETS SS BENEFITS. ME? I DONT DO DRUGS OR ANY ILLEGAL SHIT ON MY OWN INTENTION OR WILL WHATSOEVER, I DONT GET DIDDLY DICK.

And now I have another phone meeting with these fucking cocksuckers in 3 days and considering i decided not to get my bloodwork that I was suppose to go to on Feb 1st and the rescheduled date, you can tell how much confidence I have in actually getting a god damn nickel form these government motherfucking penny-pinching cocksuckers. They support drug dealing motherfuckers and crackwhores, but fuck people like me because I fucking miss one or two appointments because i have absolutely no fucking way to actually get there considering I HAVE NO CAR OR NO LICENSE TO DRIVE. TRANSPORTATION COSTS MONEY, I HAVE NO MONEY, WHERE THE FUCK DO I WIN IN THIS SITUATION? NONE OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS WILL HELP ME, NONE OF THEM WONT GET ME OUT OF THIS FUCKED UP SITUATION BECAUSE MY FUCKING DUMB OLD PIECE OF SHIT GRANDMOTHER HID ALL OF THE BULLSHIT FROM ALL OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ADMITTED THEY COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING LONG AGO IF THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS SOONER. SHE CONSTANTLY HIDES SHIT, AND PROLONGS THE TORMENT I GO THROUGH, INTENTIONALLY. EVEN WHEN I NEED ABSOLUTE CRITICAL HELP, SHE FUCKING PRAYS TO HER GOD AND SAYS ""JESUS WILL FIX THIS"" LIKE A FUCKING RELIGIOUS FUCKING MORON WHO RELIES ON A FUCKING CARTOON GHOST THAN ACTUALLY BE FUCKING RESPONSIBLE. SHE ALSO LETS MY FAT ASS AUNT MANIPULATE HER AND LETS HER GET AWAY WITH ALL OF THE FUCKED UP SHIT SHE DOES WHEN SHE KNOWS THIS FAT BITCH DOES THIS FUCKED UP SHIT THAT THREATENS MY LIFE AND MY SAFETY. This fat bitch almost made me lose the house multiple times, and my grandmother who trusts her stupid ass daughter LETS HER BACK IN THE HOUSE AFTER SHE GOT ARRESTED AND GIVES HER HER OWN HOUSE KEY.

So you know what, this time, I decided ""why am I wasting my time with these cocksuckers?"" So fuck it.

So what do I do at this point? Cause I'm not going back to no god damn hospitals. Even for something like if I get injured, I am THROUGH with fucking hospitals. I aint going to no group home either, cause if I EVER make it out of this fucked up BULLSHIT in whatever fucking mythical universe that exists out there, I WILL CUT TIES WITH MY ENTIRE FAMILY AND EVERYONE IN MY LIFE, AND MOVE AWAY AND LIVE SECLUDED IN A APARTMENT WHERE NO ONE CAN LIVE WITH ME, COME OVER, OR BOTHER ME OR FUCKING RUIN WHAT LITTLE SANITY I HAVE LEFT AS A FUCKING HUMAN BEING, AND I WONT HAVE TO DEPEND ON ANYONE ANYMORE...

but we know THAT'S a fucking pipedream considering I dont have a dime to my disgraced name. You want to know how fucked up my life is right now? I have to sleep and lock myself up in a room for the ENTIRE DAY, and when these other two motherfuckers are in bed, I come out and will be able to use my computer at fucking 2 AM until 6 AM, then I go back into my room before I have to interact with either one of them, and I do this cycle endlessly to keep me fucking killing myself or murdering both of them. And I have been doing this for 6 weeks so far. I am MISERABLE, I HATE MY LIFE, AND I WANT TO DIE A HORRIBLE PAINFUL DEATH SO I CAN FINALLY JUST BE OUT OF ALL OF THIS SHIT. I WILL BE OUT OF THIS AND ILL BE OUT OF ALL OF IT.

HOW DO I GET OUT OF THIS FUCKED UP BULLSHIT BEFORE I END UP JUST FUCKING KILLING MYSELF AND LEAVING WHAT LITTLE I HAVE BEHIND AND WHAT LITTLE I HAVE TO LIVE FOR.

Advice on how to support my bf (24M) dealing w depression after a diagnosis,110dewg,ThrowRA5927626638,1676200468.0,3,1.0,"I could really use someone’s help here, my thoughts are racing like crazy right now. First off I’m using a throwaway because bf uses Reddit a lot. And writing on mobile so please excuse any errors.

Things have been really tense between bf and I lately due to us both dealing with more work stress, and my bf has been struggling with constant pain that makes it hard for him to walk and do his job. He got it checked out, and the diagnosis is not something that will be easy to treat, and will likely affect him for the rest of his life, though it is not life threatening in any way. The pain is debilitating even with his medicine and of course it has completely been affecting his mood and treatment towards me.

Tonight he had perhaps a bit too much to drink with a friend, and afterwards opened up to me about how depressed he feels regarding the situation, and since he is so young making it extra shocking. I won’t go into detail but he was expressing some S.I. and isolating himself from me by saying he didn’t want to be a burden and that I would never understand how he felt. I tried to soothe his worries but his emotions were running so high that he turned on me asking what reason could I possibly have to be depressed (I’m diagnosed with MDD). It hurt badly to hear that when he knows my past trauma. He even opened the car door while I was going about 20 mph and it scared me that he would jump out.

He has never behaved like this before. I can Tell he is suffering so much. We fought before bed and he said he is sick of our relationship. His voice didn’t even sound like him, he had a drawl to his words and extreme bitterness. Soon after, we fought again about him checking in with a former flame he was texting at midnight.

This is a huge change from his past behavior and I wonder if he really is trying to push me away so he can dig a deeper mental hole. Do you think this a warning sign someone will hurt themselves? Any advice on how to deal with this?

TLDR: bf has been understandably upset due to some health issues. I want to be supportive but I am very hurt by his recent actions and would like advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110dewg/advice_on_how_to_support_my_bf_24m_dealing_w/

How much Melatonin is too much??,110kem3,NiccoloXMachiavelli,1676221143.0,1,1.0,"I'm currently on Buspirone at 300mg a day for Anxiety, and of course what else do I have, good ole insomnia, lucky me, NOT!

A long time ago when I was on SSRI's, which I am no longer taking, only the Buspirone right now. When I took the SSRI's and a sleep medication I could take zolpidem (ambien) 10 mg and it would eventually knock me out. I've tried taking zolpidem (ambien) 10 mg, now, it no longer works at all. This was a shock because it used to do the trick, it would knock me out, not anymore though.

I was also prescribed Lunesta 3 MG, didn't work at all.

Then prescribed Trazodone 150mg, I got woozy, more like a high, but nothing to get me to sleep, just a feel good high, that was it, nothing else.

Before taking all of this I was already taking 13mg of Melatonin, lately though sometimes this isn't enough. So most of the time I take an additional 1mg and if that doesn't do it, it's rare, I've taken a 3mg instead of a 1mg. Melatonin13mg used to be fine for me, it got me to sleep, now at times I'm finding I have to go up an additional 1 mg, rarely a 3mg though. I took the 3mg just to ""quickly"" make me get to sleep.  You could say, ""3mg for the supersonic guarantee of a push off to sleep.""

So been taking Melatonin 13mg, but now been taking 1mg, rarely 3mg.

Has anyone else been taking this much of Melatonin or more??

It's working for me, and none of the other prescriptions don't work for me, so at this point I have no choice. Well I do have a choice, it's get no sleep at night and sleep at irregular hours through out the day or take Melatonin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110kem3/how_much_melatonin_is_too_much/

I filled out a depression history chart and she asked me for more details, I gave her my family history and that my counselor reccomends medication. She asked if I would be comfortable with that, I said yes, and she prescribed me Lexapro. I felt good about it especially since my last doc never took me seriously, but I feel like since it was so fast it could be a bad idea. I just don’t know what to do though; if I should just not take it, or what.


She has me starting on 5mg for a week and then switching to 10, so I could just take 5mg for longer and then switch, but she has a check in within 2 weeks so I don’t know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110kaxr/bad_idea_to_take_the_lexapro_i_was_prescribed/

I don't know what to do anymore,110gtx9,Ilovecupcakeslol,1676211739.0,1,0.99,"I have depression and I've been trying to be happy, but something always ruins my happiness. My grandmother, who I live with, is controlling. I've just become a teenager, but she forces me to do what she wants me to do. She does love me and take care of me, which I am grateful for, but she doesn't care about how I feel. She said it herself. I know that I'm still young and I can still make bad choices, but I am not 7 years old. I am mature and people my age and people who are under the age of 18 but over the age of 13 are labeled as kids and I don't like that. I'm not denying that we're kids, but it feels childish to be labeled as that when we're teenagers. A lot of adults also act as if we can't be mature and make choices for ourselves when we can. I feel that I am mature because I've experienced a lot of trauma, even when I was younger than I am now. It has messed me up and even I have flaws, but I've learned and am still learning. My family has abused me in the past and my grandmother hasn't changed at all while everyone else did. I've confronted my grandmother about how she behaves countless times, but she never changes. She plays victim too. She lies to my other family members and says that I disrespect her when I just stand up for myself. My other family members never believe me either. They always believe my grandmother, blame me, and criticize me. My grandmother loves removing the context of the whole situations SHE causes. She threatened to hit me because I didn't make the bed up yet (I was planning to) and I told her that I would not allow her to hit me just because of that and she got all up in my face and attempted to hit me but I pushed her away with my feet, which she ""considered"" kicking. And she went on and on about how I kicked her without mentioning that she threatened me and even attempted to hit me. She pretended to call the police and she even talked about how if other family members knew, they'd beat me up and she threatened to shoot me. I have given up on defending myself because it never does anything. I'm not a pushover (at least I try not to be) but I always end up doing what she wants. She makes me uncomfortable sometimes too. She was going to another city to visit another family member and I didn't want to go because I wanted alone time (I'm with her almost all the time unless I'm at school) but she was trying to force me to go anyway. The city that she was going to wasn't even that far away from the city I was in. She said she could be charged with neglect and that it was illegal to leave me home by myself which isn't true. I've done research on that and it's completely legal to leave me alone to go to another city for a bit. She also talked about how she wouldn't leave me home to allow a man to rape me. I know that dangerous people exist and that something bad could happen to me, but I know how to defend myself and I know how to stay safe. This is the part that made me uncomfortable. She said that she wouldn't allow a man to rape me, which it's good to not want anyone to rape a teenager, but a man could do anything. The person doesn't even have to be a man to be dangerous. It could be a woman and it doesn't have to be rape. Any bad thing can happen, but out of all things, she chooses rape to talk about. She knows that her mentioning things like that makes me uncomfortable. She even asked me if a man touched me before to make me behave the way I do (she didn't ask this out of concern, she asked this because she wanted me to behave the way she wanted me to behave). She always talks about sexual things that make me uncomfortable being fully aware that I am uncomfortable with it. And if I was misbehaving, ANYTHING could've happened. It doesn't have to be sexual, yet she makes things sexual and it feels horrible. I don't like it at all.

I am 15 year old.

For this past month I've been thinking about a lot of mistakes that happened in the past that I wish I could go back and fix. It first started late December and I thought that I was just overthinking and I thought I would stop thinking about it after a week. But it is still going on. It fatigues my mind and I simply wish it could stop and I would go back to normal. Today is a Saturday and I woke up at 4 after coming home at 10am after getting 5 hours of sleep at my buddy's house and then going back to sleep, I slept over there because it was his birthday. Today I sat around on my phone doing nothing and just scrolling on Tiktok, on a regular Saturday I would be playing video games right now. I was on my phone for so long that when I finally looked at the time I was surprised because it was 11 and it didn't even feel like I was on my phone for that long. Yesterday on my way to my friends house I was in my car and I felt like someone was sitting on my chest, like there was a heavy weight on it. After a while at my friends the feeling stopped because I was occupied with other things and I can longer think about it. I was talking to my dad about it, I asked him ""Do you ever just feel like trash"" and he said yeah. He's a hard working man that works a lot because of my mom's injury she had at work so I understood him but I don't understand why I feel like trash. I don't know any reasons for me feeling like this. The best way I can describe this feeling is that I physically feel tired and ill. Its hard for me to describe it.

I don't feel like I don't belong here or want to harm myself, I just wanna stop feeling like this. I don't know if there is something physically/mentally wrong with me I just want it to stop. My mothers side of my family is affected by mental illness (Bipolar and severe anxiety) and I don't know if it is effected me. Writing this makes me feel better, and I skipped out a lot of detail but if some of this is confusing or doesn't make sense, I'm sorry I just wanted to talk about it.

I just filed a Leave of Absence to focus on treating my MDD—and I'm feeling anything but hopeful,11092il,takingflame,1676183464.0,3,1.0,"I'm finally taking a break from college and everything after almost 5 years of being chronically suicidal. This hasn't been an easy decision by any means. Aside from being a perfectionist who grew up having my identity revolve around my academic performance, I currently have a fantastic group of close friends (that I never dreamed of having because of my social anxiety and experiences with bullying), and I want to graduate with them. However, my depressive episodes have gotten really bad and frequent. It's gotten so debilitating that I can't do even the bare minimum on most days.

I honestly can't tell what I'm feeling or how I'm doing. Just that I'm exhausted. Now that I don't have to go to school and take care of myself (while my mom's here to visit), the depressive symptoms are becoming really apparent. Of course, they've always been here for the most part, but I think this is the first time I've truly let them be without fighting back or repressing them temporarily, or even masking how I truly feel. It's liberating yet saddening all at the same time.

I know I'm supposed to start taking the steps to recovery now that I finally have the time and space to do so, but I'm just too tired. Maybe I also don't see the point in trying. There's still this huge part of me that feels like I'm gonna die soon anyway, and that it prefers death over the future and life I might have if I work hard in treatment. (Perhaps this is the depression talking. Or me. Most days I can't tell where I end and where the depression starts.)

With everything I know about MDD (and how the recurrence rate increases with every episode) and my history of multiple episodes, I think a part of me feels like it's too late. Like how cancer cells have spread so far already in people with Stage 4 cancer, I think I've suffered from depression and multiple episodes \[long\] enough for it to have caused irreversible damage. Maybe it's beyond the powers of treatment, and my looming death is inevitable. Or, if I somehow don't end up killing myself and continue to live, I will be carrying with me this huge scar that will shape my life, whether I like it or not. Life won't be the same again. Of course, it's not like I could've lived a depression-free life (since the cause of my MDD is partly genetic). But I could've lived a life where I wasn't crippled by it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11092il/i_just_filed_a_leave_of_absence_to_focus_on/

After 4 years of talking about it me and my fiance had moved in together and we were living together. It had been about 2 months. I didn't show her the love that I should have showed her. My eyes always wandered a little too much and we both knew that and it bothered her and I didn't stop it. That morning of December 16th after I got out of the shower I found all the doors locked and her telling me that she hated me and that I needed to leave. She threatened to call the police on me for what reason I still don't know and with that I called my brother threw my stuff into a car and ran. I made it to my shift 3 hours late and stayed 3 hours late. At the time I was building up money to get my car fixed and then to move in with her to a more permanent housing situation.

February 12, 2022.
I've lost 30 lb and I'm now down to a measly 115. I can't eat and most of the time I can't sleep. After running on autopilot and doing as much work for as long as I could I quit my job due to a quick Rebound with a girl at work going horribly wrong as she began to make my life a living hell. After working myself to death to run away from my feelings I finally have nothing to hide behind and the darkness is spreading into the rest of my day. The car which I thought would only cost a few hundred is going to cost close to two grand to fix. I'm currently paying off school credit card debt this car and it all feels like a series of waking up going to work going home going to bed waiting for numbers to rise high enough so that goals can be accomplished and then I can set new goals which will be met by accruing more money. 

It feels like my life has ended and it's just me continuing to live. A body without a soul going through the motions unable to stop because I don't know how. I'm consumed with grief and guilt and anger and shame. Part of me blames myself for attracting someone who would do something like this part of me wonders if I made them part of me wonders if it even matters either way.

I would give anything to feel the way I felt before I met her. Happy to be alone proud to be myself ready to go out and take the World by storm. I feel like a soldier who's been defeated one too many times and just can't keep going. I could but what's the point when I've already seen every side of the war?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110ee87/gone_reduced_to_atoms/

To be more specific, i don’t feel like i found a group of people who truly appreciate me, and i feel like i struggle a lot with codependency. I put in so much for others because i want any little thing in return, but i never get it and people walk all over me.

Well I probably should have seen that I was about to have one of the worst mental breakdowns ever but it has never been this bad before so I did not know what to expect. Today my father asked me to clean the corner around his bed, there were dead roaches there and I hate bugs and tried to get out of picking then up buf he kept trying to get me to pick them up up and got annoyed because I wouldn't do it. That seemed to be the straw that broke the camel's back. I just lost it, because of all the pressure of hiding how I felt building up, I started crying and screaming and shaking and I was screaming a bunch of thoughts that were connected properly. He sat me down and he was asked what was wrong and I kind of broke. I just told him everything, I told him how I didn't want to live and I was thinking about killing myself, I had no desire to be here and I was mad at everyone and how I just wanted a break and I wish I never existed. I did not love his response fully I did appreciate it because he said they (as in him and my mother) were going to be there for me but they did mention God and getting to know him and I didnt really like that because me and religion don't really have a great relationship but outside of that I really liked the response. In the end it was nice to just cry and let it all out and scream and shout and ball and actually say out loud what was bothering me it was nice to tell someone, it was was really reliveing. Someone in my comments on my last post said sometimes you just need to cry it out and now I see I really did need that.

I want to have hobbies but can't, nothing brings me joy. I used to love playing basketball, drawing, working out every day etc. I listen to music all day to drown out the fact I am thoughtless. I've become a void that doesn't even think for myself.

It's gotten to a point where I force myself to go on walks that I don't even enjoy. I don't breathe in the scenery around me, I just look to finish the job, which is to get home. 

Talking drains me as well, I can't bother to talk in long sentences because it tires me.

Tiktok basically took over my life. My dopamine levels are at an all-time low. The ""thrilling"" system of random entertainment videos makes me scroll for hours on end.

That was 5 years ago and I won but was on the verge of bankruptcy. I worked half to death to survive. Now 3years later and I’ve payed off 80% of that debt.

To sum up some of my life so far, I have extremely severe depression, anxiety, and panic attacks (which I’ve started medication for), I was raped at the start of 2021, I’m affection or touch starved, whatever you’d call the feeling of craving physical affection like to be held or hugged or have my head pat. I’ve been cheated on several times, been emotionally abused more times then I can count, I’ve lost a best friend to suicide, I’m struggling in school, I don’t have many friends anymore that I can genuinely say are my friends, maybe 2 or 3, my mother cheated on my dad a few years ago and they divorced 2 years ago, I’m glad that she’s out of my life in all honesty as in the lightest of ways she’s not healthy for me to be around, i get verbally abused by my family every day, I’ve been bullied for about 2 thirds of my school life, I’m a person who can’t help but overthink every thought, even the simplest of scenarios involve me going through 500 different possible outcomes and stressing over what to do or what to say. I’ve got no passions, no motivations, no one loves me, not even my family, I finally found someone who did, a girl who lives in Florida, her name was Destiny and she was my bestest friend, for the first time in years I heard someone say I love you and was able to tell that they genuinely meant it, even though it was a very slim chance of me even meeting her in person I didn’t care, I was just happy to have found her and a community of people I met from her that genuinely cared about me for once, that made me so happy, that gave me hope. But I screwed that up about 3 weeks ago… so now I’m alone again.

That’s the main things at least, I’m not trying to get any sympathy from telling whoever reads this my troubles, I’m just venting a bit

I’ve felt suicidal for a while now, and the scariest part for people when I tell them is that I’m not afraid of death, I welcome it, but the only thing that’s kept me until now is that I didn’t want to hurt the people that cared about me, but now that that’s gone, it’s hard to find a reason to live anymore, like what’s the point in life? Why do I have to go through so many traumatic experiences before I’m even an adult, what did I do wrong in life, where did I go wrong? What kind of god up there did I upset so horribly that I can’t hold on to one good thing in this life? These are the sort of questions that go through my head each day, coupled with the suicidal ones

The only thing I really enjoy in life is anime, to me at least, it’s like an escape to a different world, I get to experience through anime what happiness could look like and see some cool fight scenes or beautiful illustrations along the way, it gives me a small amount of happiness, but sadly it’s only a minuscule and temporary amount of happiness
 
I just, I don’t know anymore, I don’t even know who I am or what I should do, so I guess this is my last stand to reach out for some kind of help, whether it’s to just kill myself and move on or keep suffering with the hope that things will get better somewhere in the next 5-50 years, I need someone to tell me what to do, how do I go on, or do I even go on anymore, you know?

I don't know why I feel like this,110ddg0,Sad-Difference-2788,1676200319.0,1,1.0,"Hi everyone, I am graduated from my school (high school equivalent), currently 20yrs old.

I really like mathematics, but people found me weird and didn't have much friends. But when I was in secondary school,(age 13-16) I met someone who was equally passionate about maths...we were good friends and I made other new friends as well through him. But when we were 16yrs old, my friend took his life in school....I managed to feel better even though I still carried the sadness in my heart but didn't let it bother me. But when I was in junior college (age 17-18), I focused on doing well in mathematics as I wanted to be a mathematician, it was my remedy to my sadness of losing my friend. But in junior college I met a teacher who I admired a lot...she was like a mother figure to me, and was a lot like my friend in terms of passion. And my school did this video thing where they broadcast the top scorer for maths, and in my second year (final year), for my prelims(last exam), I finally managed to get the top spot and even early admission to my local university ( I was over the moon) and was excited to see the video broadcast of myself.

But they didn't make it at that time...I didn't have the courage to ask my teacher back then why they didn't make it( I mean they could have forgotten right?), But after I graduated I went to serve my nation in the police force (mandatory thing), but while training I was also interested in doing a research paper on the side to keep myself motivated. But I needed help so I contacted my teacher, but while talking to her I remembered the video thing and told her about it and that I was upset about it. However, she laughed at it, and I lost my cool by calling her a bitch..  I know I shouldn't have done that....

She proceeded to block me on WhatsApp and I felt really guilty..so I called her through normal phone call and apologized to her and told her about my childhood issues and sadness. She told me that I was a very motivated and capable student and that she wasn't worried about my future, but she asked me to seek help regarding my mental health, to which I agreed. She also said she would help me regarding my questions in the research paper. However, a few days later she messaged me and said she won't help me anymore and didn't give a reason why....I tried calling her and messaging her but no response.... eventually I got a call from my supervisors that the school lodged a police report for harassment against me..... I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me...I mean I get it I hurt her feelings but we talked about it and she isn't obligated to help me after graduation but still to make a police report like that was like the school gave up on me...I tried to harm myself but my parents stopped me in time....my boss in police talked to the other officers and prevented me from having a criminal record as long as I went for counselling and I agreed to it(I mean I was already going for it just that now more people are aware of it). But I still feel empt like no more passion and I keep thinking about my late friend and how it would be nice to just end it here and now but at the same time none of the suicide methods worked...so I gave up on that also...


I don't know what to do, what to feel or can I even change my life.....I want to show to my teacher that I have recovered and won't make the same mistakes...I try to think about the positive words she gave me, I try to think about my friends. But sometimes the negative thoughts just floodback to me and I feel suicidal again...is there anyone who felt like this...is there any way to turn things around...my counselling is only once every three months due to busy work schedule and also I can't mention my suicidal thoughts or else it will go down in my records.... that's why I can here.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks 🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110ddg0/i_dont_know_why_i_feel_like_this/

There are hybrid models too, like working from home 2 days a week and going to the office 3 days a week, but I feel like that wouldn't make the social aspect that much better as not all colleagues will be at work when you are.

I admit not seeking medication / proper ongoing help sooner was my downfall but I had periods where I felt ok but have had lots of dips over the last several years.

I decided I would do what I need to turn things around but feel so awful about lost time and not having anything to stand on.  

Is anyone else in their late 30s and been able to turn things around? My family think it’s laziness (which just makes me feel ten times worse) as they simply don’t understand dips.

I'm afraid to talk to anyone about my mental state and I constantly have to change my personality depending on who I am talking to, to maintain my image of how I want people to see me.

Feeling overwhelmed,1102xd4,submarinedreams,1676163182.0,4,1.0,"Feeling too tired and stressed to keep going. I was first diagnosed with depression at age 13 when I told my mom I was having suicidal thoughts. I am 30 now and while it's not like I've never had a good day, I've never had a period (hell, even a single moment) in life where I felt like life was worth it. Even on my best days, if I could have pressed a button that would have made me never exist, I would have pressed it without hesitation.

I've been in and out of therapy and on and off medications, but nothing has helped. Part of me believed that I had an unrealistically high expectation of what my baseline mood should be; and that I was depressed because I thought my baseline mood should be happier. But if my baseline mood is what it has been at for over half of my life, then I don't have a will to go on knowing that this is what it will continue to be like.

I am too scared to actually commit suicide because I don't have health insurance or life insurance right now as I just switched jobs. I don't want to leave my husband with a dead wife and no life insurance payout for a funeral. I also don't want to fail at the attempt and wind up with a hospital bill I can't afford and permanent damage to my body. I wish assisted suicide was available in my country.

Sometimes I have shared my suicidal thoughts with my husband, but it (understandably) makes him feel frustrated that I feel this way and he can't help. He gets angry and tells me I should to go therapy. I have gone to many therapists for many years but haven't ever felt like I wanted to stay alive.

I don't really know who else to reach out to for support. When I've told my mom about my suicidal thoughts in the past, she has put me in an inpatient psychiatric facility several times, which I can't afford. I moved across the country during covid and haven't met that many friends, at least not that I would consider close enough to confide in something like this. Haven't really kept in touch with old friends to the point where I could lean on them for support out of the blue. Don't really have much contact with my extended family.

I don’t even know man,110apbn,215tylish,1676189960.0,1,1.0,"This is my story on how i lost everything due to a tab of LSD

The start of 2022 id like to say that i was at my peak of life, Looking back now i had everything. I was very fit had an amazing lean body, was taking boxing classes and hitting the gym every day, cooking very healthy and diet based meals for myself, had a ton of friends that i loved spending time with and just being a good person to everyone i knew. I was a very extroverted person that couldn’t stand being alone in a room for more than 2 hours, I was always out and about.

Fast forward to July where everything started to fall apart. I had family problems for pretty much all my life with my dad and never getting along we would always argue and bring alot of stress to my mom and sisters, and then one day my friends and i were in my room and he walked in drunk and me and him got into a physical fight and he ended up kicking me, I wasn’t sad but very angry, angry that my friends had to witness that happen, so one of my friends let me stay at his place and a few nights later we decided to take a trip to ontario to visit my cousin and just get away for a few weeks so we did and ended up having a very good time until the last day, the last day of our stay we went to niagra falls and took lsd, we went out in public and it was the most terrifying experience of my life, the second i made contact with another person i couldnt talk properly and was very tripped out about everything my whole mind was flooded with anxiety and panic and I couldn’t come to terms with myself and when we eventually got back to the hotel i spent the whole night just staring at the ceiling thinking of all the terrible things that have happened in my life. When the drug wore off in the morning i felt very odd around my friends and when we got back home I started work again and had anxiety around everyone to the point I couldn’t work there anymore i was constantly tripping out in my mind like i dont know whats right and wrong and i dont know how to act like a normal human being around society

Fast forward 6 months and my life is so shitty and miserable because of this anxiety and everyone could see it legit the second i talk to someone i get anxious and my mind freezes and doesn’t know how to comprehend information and everyone gives me an odd look because they see that something isnt right with me, I’ve legit cut out every friend that i was close with out of my life i dont talk to anyone and barely leave my house because i dont know how to act and how to think properly, my muscles hurt eveytime i try to workout not a soar pain but they actually hurt the second i pick up a weight and im constantly tripping out over everything and have a hard time processing information like nothing makes sence i spend most of my day staring at the floor and thinking of nothing i cant hide this problem and i have been seeing different therapists and psychiatrists but none help because i don’t remember anything we talk about im just very anxious around them as i am with everyone i know, i dont know what to do, like i dont want to be around people because i cant relate and know how to act or what to say and it sucks because i was never like this went from an extroverted guy that everyone loved being around to an introverted piece of shit that cant do anything about his situation, i just can’t believe that this happened to me i really cant and to lose that person that i once was sucks anxiety sucks and i hate that people have to see me like this i was never this weak and i just simply dont want to live anymore like losing eveything and constantly feeling like you’ve lost your mind and every family member and friend can see that somethings wrong with u that u have an issue with your brain is so tramatizing and theres is no going back. idk what else to do the only thing I’d want is to feel how i felt before the lsd trip but that is never going to happen, ive lost my mind at his point and theres no way back",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/110apbn/i_dont_even_know_man/

My memory sucks and I don't know who I am,1106jlt,Phaelicannot,1676174518.0,2,1.0,"I (16F) have had memory issues for all my life. I am diagnosed with ADD, and poor memory is a symptom. However, my memory is so bad I have forgotten so many things that have made me as a person. That on top of an unstable, stress filled childhood with some trauma added in, leaves me with so many holes in my memory. I stopped doing much for a couple of years too from the age of 9 to about 14, no idea if it was from depression, ADHD or laziness, but I don't have much to take from those years. I also don't have much of a family (I live with a stressed single mom, and basically the only other person in our family we actually meet regularily is my grandmother, who often ends up venting to my mom), which means I never got to do family activities or watch movies together and things like that after the first few years of my life which I do not remember. When looking back and trying to retrieve the memories I do have, I get very sad, because it requires so much energy to try to remember.

I have a hard time talking about nostalgic things, because I either don't remember or I didn't live my life enough to experience much. Since I also suffer from depression now, I can't really make up for all the time and experience I lost, because I simply do not have the energy. When looking at other people enjoy their hobbies that they have been enjoying for a long time, or talk about movies, books, songs and other things that give them nostalgic feelings, I just want to cry. I feel so empty, like there is a huge hole in my personality, and I cannot fill it because I can't get the memories and time I've already lost back. 

I cannot make new memories either because I am stressed to death and constantly in my head and I want to die every single day, the background issues add up on my day to day stress and depression, and it just overwhelmes me because I do not want to live a life where I have lost basically all my childhood, I would rather die. Even if I am actually in a good mood, whenever I get reminded of anything about family or childhood I get depressed and even suicidal again.

This is a nightmare and I don't know how to fix it. A part of me doesn't even want to try to cover these holes because I am just so angry over the fact that they are there in the first place. I have treated my mother very unfairly because I get so angry because of the consequences of her past marriage. I know it is not her fault but I cannot help but be angry.

Is this really what I will have to live with? No childhood, being just a shell of a person, just superficial things because I simply do not have a proper ground my personality can stand on. Not remembering the majority of my life, not having a proper family that I could make memories with, never actually living. I would rather die than fight to fix myself, because the holes will always be there either way, even if they are covered they will never actually disappear. It is all a nightmare, please help.

I just don’t know what to do anymore,1108sej,no_nuns-none,1676182431.0,1,1.0,"I’m so depressed, I can’t get help, I just don’t know what to do. I feel like lately my life has been one shit pile after another. I don’t even remember most of my childhood due to trauma; I offhandedly mentioned 3 different events in my life on a different post and was told the post should have a trigger warning for the amount of abuse I listed. That wasn’t even all of it, it wasn’t even half of it. My parents forced me to meet with my abusive biological mother in middle school by myself to write my own parenting plan with her. I was recently told my guardian ad litem thought I was getting groomed and I only found out this year at 25. 

I had to quit my job due to a disability I developed after getting into a car accident at work, they told me they would not give me the accommodations I needed, then lied to the unemployment office so I couldn’t receive and money. I recently found out I can’t legally get married to my fiancé or I’d lose all my benefits. I thought that since I couldn’t find a job that fit my needs and could be remote (I’m not allowed to drive due to my disability and am not close enough to a bus station to travel myself) that I would try to get a degree and even with only 2 classes the workload is making me spiral into a depression. This is my fourth time trying to get a degree and I feel like an absolute loser at how hard this this for me. 

I can’t even shower. I don’t remember the last time I showered. The last time I brushed my teeth my gums started bleeding it had been so long. 

I’ve been isolating in my bedroom (which is making my depression worse) because one of my roommates is also having mental health issues and I can’t stand to be around their angry outbursts and self sabotage. 

I have a referral to a psychiatrist but they’ve been playing phone tag with me for a month now. 

I recently got scammed by a hair and makeup artist that stole $891 from me and I can’t even try to press charges until next month, if I even have the energy for it. 

I keep begging for help and I get nothing. My roommates (who are also in my wedding party) keep offering to help then do virtually nothing, except one did help me find a new MUA. They are in charge of a bridal shower bbq that’s in March but have done nothing, I had to find the location, date, and make and send the invites myself. All they have to figure out is food and music and yet… nothing. I already had a wonderful bachelor party hosted by my fiancé’s best man and MOH (we both wanted one of each), not I’m not doing anything related to the bbq and am just going to watch what happens. 

I have been begging and crying for help from my fiancé, but he just won’t do anything until there is a major problem. I had been begging to quit my last job as it sent me to the hospital due to stress induced psychosis and he just kept telling me to hold it out, even going and far as using my phone to text my boss that I was suicidal (I’m not sure what that was supposed to do for me). I ask for help and he says he’ll help, then says he’s too tired, or doesn’t want to, or that he’ll “do it tomorrow” and the cycle continues until days/weeks/months pass. I’ve started reminding myself that asking for help means nothing, and that if I can’t do it myself it’s not happening. 

Yesterday I once again told him I was incredibly far behind on schoolwork and begged for help (body doubling to keep me working) and he said he would. He also said he would help me shower as it’s been probably close to two weeks since I have showered. My depression is affecting my ability to get out of bed, as is my disability. I also can’t stand or lift my arms over my head for more than a few minutes when in the shower. Lately my fiancé has had to help me, which only makes me feel even more helpless. We agreed yesterday that he would take a half day at work to help me shower and body double but instead he invited a coworker over and didn’t come into the bedroom until 9:30pm. And he wanted to taste wedding cake options. I smell and feel disgusting and hopeless and I had to pretend this was the special moment I wanted it to be. And then he fell asleep immediately. 

I love him so so much, and I could go on for days about all the sweet things he’s done for me, but it’s like he’s got a secret ability to tell when I need help the most and does the opposite. I don’t know what to do. I don’t think my insurance covers inpatient and it did little for me last time. I’m trying so hard not to fall into bad habits but I’m already forgetting to eat which is always the first step in me spiraling. 

I don’t think there is any helping me but this is the first time I’ve put all my issues down in one place and at least it doesn’t seem like I’m losing it over nothing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1108sej/i_just_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/

what if you are misdiagnosed?,10zte9w,sakura_520,1676137800.0,9,1.0,"It's hard to believe I can be depressed. I have always been a jolly person, I even acted like a child sometimes and that was less than a year ago. It's all too sudden. 

I've been through a series of unfortunate events in the past few months and am highly dissatisfied with EVERYTHING in my life. Maybe I'm just sad about all those things. 

I'm on antidepressants but they're making me more miserable and my mind's all foggy( a part of me doesn't want to take anti depressants anyway even without the sideeffects)

Here's why I think I may not be depressed
I just want someone to tell me if those are good enough reasons so I can talk to my psychiatrist

1. Last night I got an idea for a novel, and ended up writing close to 600 words, even mapped out the plot. I actually thought I finally have something to live for. So I guess amidst hopelessness I still have moments of motivation. 

2. I'm generally able to sleep well, but there are times when I wake up in the middle of the night feeling disgustingly horrible. This doesn't seem to be an issue with sleep itself, as I don't have insomnia or excessive sleeping habits.

3. I really need someone I can emotionally connect with. I do have friends but all those conversations seem too superficial and redundant. They are amazing people, but I can't ever open my heart to them. Maybe what I am experiencing is the pain of social loneliness and not depression.

4. People say they feel numb when depressed. I can relate, I've even noticed a tone of indifference in my voice but I rather feel restless. I constantly have this feeling of being trapped inside my body. If there's such thing as a soul, it surely is bouncing off the walls of my skull.

5. I'm not always suicidal. Such thoughts come in waves when I face even a minor inconvenience. They're short-lived and when the feeling subsides, I no longer have any desire to die.

6. There are jokes that *genuinely* make me laugh. 

7. I feel good when I get something done. I takes a lot of courage to get a task done but the point is that there's *something* that makes me feel better even for a while...and without meds. 

8. I've always been lazy. It is maybe my mind tricking me into thinking I am not feeling good so I can avoid tasks. My biggest fear is LYING TO MYSELF. I don't ever want to lie to myself. But I'll never know if my brain's tricking me.
Although I'm always with my thoughts. I feel as if I no longer understand myself. Mind is a strange strange place. 

P.S I understand depression can be different for everyone. I have very limited knowledge on depression so please don't be rude.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10zte9w/what_if_you_are_misdiagnosed/
Why am I alone,11089jd,AdTop4959,1676180544.0,1,1.0,"So I’ve recently realized I have toxic empathy. These last couple weeks it’s definitely been getting to me. I feel so alone. I have no one to talk to. Everyone always asks me how I’m so happy, kind and patient all the time. People come to me with their problems or when they need something. People even gossip about others to me and I take in that negativity so it ends with me rather than tell the person who the gossip is about. Almost every night I watch my friends Snapchat stories and I see them all out having fun together, without me there. I never get invited places. If I want to see anybody I have to initiate. That’s been my entire life. The background friend. I know it’s not because they don’t enjoy my presence. It’s just no one thinks about me. No one asks if I’m ok. I work 40 hours a week, take care of my 4 beautiful kids and my 3 cats and dog. My kids dad just exists with them until I get off of work, which is why I’m going through a divorce that he didn’t even care to show up to so it’s my responsibility to make all the decisions going forward. I am beyond stressed and I can’t get a simple invite out. Why am I overlooked when I kill myself for others. I constantly go above and beyond but no one cares about my life. I feel like a burden.

But I can’t help but feel like a problem in all of it. I have ADHD that is pretty much untreated, with parents who didn’t care enough to get it treated or even teach me anything in life. I find myself in so many situations learning something I should have learned years ago. I love my job and everything about it, but it doesn’t offer many hours and I’m not left with much money. I find myself annoying my girlfriend constantly with my stupidity. 

I feel like my ADHD is a constant curse in my life, and that it will not get better. I feel like a burden on everyone in my life and that I either deserve to be locked up or dead. I don’t see a reason to continue with my life when it doesn’t seem to have the possibility of getting better. 

The only thing keeping me in this world is my girlfriend, but I feel like eventually she will see the lack of potential I have and decide to leave me. 

Both my therapist and my psychiatrists have also ghosted me and don’t respond to me anymore. 

I feel like a void that just sucks up all the things that it can, just to ruin them. Even when I try to do something good, I feel like it doesn’t count and is more as a repayment. I feel so undeserving of the love and care that I get from anyone and would rather them be mean or hurtful since I feel like I deserve that

Why is the first call to get help so hard?,10zwwzn,pinkbabydolleyes,1676146858.0,4,1.0,"I know that instead of thinking about what the call means, I should treat it as a reward to myself for wanting help. But it’s very anxiety inducing. Any tips to make the call less intimidating?

Update: Thank you all to those that replied. I just made the call. And it was a lot easier than I made it out to be. To those that may be struggling to make the call like I was, just do it. The person on the other line will help you. I straight up told the person I’m extremely anxious about making this call. It ended before I knew it. No more than 5 mins!",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10zwwzn/why_is_the_first_call_to_get_help_so_hard/
Is this really all there is to life,10tr5qk,anechointhedark,1675544429.0,419,1.0,"Constantly crying, always anxious, lonely, hating myself. It's getting to a point AGAIN where I don't even care anymore. Barely eat, can't sleep or sleep too much. I don't socialize or anything. Whats the point anymore? I genuinely don't understand what to do. I'm not living. I'm just surviving at this point.

Sleep is the closest I have to not being alive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10tr5qk/is_this_really_all_there_is_to_life/
